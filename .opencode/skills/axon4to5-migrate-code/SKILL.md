# axon4to5-migrate-code

## Goal

> Fully (or as most as possible) compiling, green-test codebase on AF5, **same architecture as AF4**.
> No DCB. No new patterns. Legacy event storage preserved.
>
> **Scope: code and configuration only.** This skill migrates source code and wiring. It does **NOT**
> migrate stored data — the event store contents (stored events) and tracking tokens are left untouched.
> Migrating to AF5 with the legacy event-storage layout keeps those stores compatible as-is; moving data
> to a new storage layout (e.g. DCB) is out of scope.
> The migration preserves the project's existing configuration style: a Spring Boot
> project stays on Spring auto-config (recipes use `@Component` / `@Bean`
> idioms); a plain framework-configuration project stays on the direct
> `Configurer` API (recipes use `EventSourcingConfigurer` /
> `MessagingConfigurer` / `CommandHandlingModule` / `EventSourcedEntityModule`).

## Available recipes (auto-listed)

Run `bash scripts/list-recipes.sh` from the skill root directory. Output format:

```
- file: references/recipes/<dir>/RECIPE.md
  id: <id>
  title: <title>
  description: <description>
  applicable: |
    <applicable section content, or "(none)" if missing>
```

## Inputs

- `framework` (**required**): which Axon flavor to migrate. Currently supported values: `axon`, `axoniq`. Any other
  value → STOP.
- `configuration` (**required**): how the application wires Axon. Currently supported values: `native`, `spring`. Any
  other value → STOP.
- `mode` (required): what gets migrated in one invocation.
    - `single` — one element (a class, e.g. an Aggregate). Requires `source`.
    - `project` — the whole application (default: current working directory). `source` ignored.
- `execution` (optional, default `inline`): how the orchestrator runs its steps. Only meaningful for `mode=project` —
  for `mode=single` it has no observable effect.
    - `inline` — main session does discovery + recipe runs sequentially. No `Agent` tool use.
    - `subagent` — orchestrator MAY dispatch via the `Agent` tool: discovery → `Explore` subagent, recipe sub-flow per
      item → `general-purpose` subagent (parallel batches). Useful for `project` mode on large codebases.
- `source` (required for `mode=single`): hint identifying the thing to migrate (class name, file path, FQN).
- `skip-openrewrite` (optional, default `false`): when `true`, the orchestrator SKIPS Pre-step 2 (the OpenRewrite bulk pass) and goes straight to the mode-specific producer. Use this when (a) OpenRewrite Phase 1 has already been run separately on the tree, (b) the caller is exercising a recipe in isolation, or (c) the project is not built with Maven/Gradle so the OpenRewrite plugin is unreachable. Values: `true` / `false`. Any other value → STOP. The downstream recipe must still tolerate both AF4-shaped and partially-migrated sources (see each recipe's `# Applicable` predicates).
- `max-subagents` (optional, default `0`): max parallel `general-purpose` subagents for item processing in the drain loop. `mode=project` only — ignored for `mode=single`. `0` = inline (no subagents, sequential). `N > 0` = dispatch up to N items simultaneously as subagents; **BLOCKER_RESOLUTION always runs in main session** regardless of this value. Any non-integer or value < 0 → STOP.
- `auto` (optional, default `false`): when `true`, never calls `AskUserQuestion` — all interactive decisions resolved automatically (see `## Auto mode`). Values: `true` / `false`. Any other value → STOP.

## Auto mode (`auto=true`)

Orchestrator makes all decisions without `AskUserQuestion`. Every auto-resolved choice emits `⚙️ auto: <decision>` so the log stays auditable.

| Decision point | Auto action |
|---|---|
| Ambiguous recipe match (`mode=single`) | Pick first candidate by `applicable` score. |
| Blocker | Auto-select the Option the recipe marked `(Recommended)`; if none is marked, `skip`. A recommended migration path (e.g. saga `stateful-rewrite`) re-enters the recipe with that option id; `skip`/`revert` resolve in-place. See `BLOCKER_RESOLUTION.md § Auto mode`. |
| Resume + selection-args mismatch | Args identical → auto-resume. Args differ → auto-start-over. |
| Working tree mismatch on resume | Proceed; record `⚠️ auto: tree mismatch ignored` in `progress.md`. |
| OpenRewrite step completes | Immediately continue to mode-specific producer. Do NOT pause or end session. |

## Durability

**Load order — see § Recipe sub-flow.** FLOW.md first, then DURABILITY.md (second). Defines state files under `.axon4to5-migration/`, hooks across pre-steps + queue + recipe results + caller decisions, and commit protocol. Reads `progress.md` on entry to decide resume vs fresh.

## Pre-steps (common to every mode)

These run **before** any mode-specific logic — independent of whether `mode=single`, `project`, or anything added later.

1. **Parse** — read `framework`, `configuration`, `mode`, `execution`, `skip-openrewrite`, `max-subagents`, `auto` from `$ARGUMENTS`.
    - If `framework` is missing or ∉ {`axon`, `axoniq`} → STOP and report unsupported framework.
    - If `configuration` is missing or ∉ {`native`, `spring`} → STOP and report unsupported configuration.
    - If `mode` is missing or ∉ {`single`, `project`} → STOP and report unsupported mode.
    - `execution` defaults to `inline` if missing. If present and ∉ {`inline`, `subagent`} → STOP and report unsupported execution.
    - `skip-openrewrite` defaults to `false` if missing. If present and ∉ {`true`, `false`} → STOP and report unsupported value.
    - `max-subagents` defaults to `0` if missing. If present and not a non-negative integer → STOP.
    - `auto` defaults to `false` if missing. If present and ∉ {`true`, `false`} → STOP.
2. **OpenRewrite** — **skipped entirely when `skip-openrewrite=true`.** Otherwise, internally invoke
   `axon4to5-openrewrite` via the `Skill` tool, passing `--framework $framework --commit false`. Do NOT pass `--commit true` or omit `--commit`; DURABILITY's `on:openrewrite-done` hook owns the single combined commit. This is a step of this orchestrator, not a separate command. Idempotent — safe even on a partially-migrated tree. If it fails → STOP and report the failure (no gap-filling on a broken bulk pass). When skipped, surface that fact in the eventual report (Notes or Learnings) so the caller knows the queue ran against unprocessed AF4 (or already-partially-migrated) sources and the recipes did all the work themselves.
   **`auto=true`: after this step returns (success or skip), immediately continue to the mode-specific producer — do NOT end the session or pause.**

Only after pre-steps complete does the mode-specific producer below run.

## Modes

### `single`

Migrate ONE element (one aggregate, one event processor, etc.) using exactly one recipe from the list above.

Steps (after the common pre-steps):

1. **Match** — map user's request + `source` to ONE recipe in the auto-listed set. Primary signal: the catalog's
   `applicable` block (surface predicates against `$SOURCE` — annotations / type markers). Fallback signal: `id` +
   `title` + `description`. If ambiguous → ask user via `AskUserQuestion` to pick (show `title` to the user; dispatch by
   `id`). If no `applicable` block matches and description is also unclear → STOP and report.
2. **Execute** — `Read` the chosen recipe file under [`references/recipes/`](references/recipes/) (`<name>/RECIPE.md`)
   and execute it per the **Recipe sub-flow** ([`FLOW.md`](references/recipes/FLOW.md), already loaded). Recipe-local
   auxiliary files (examples, fixtures, supporting docs) live alongside it in the same `<name>/` directory.
3. **Verify** — behavior is preserved (no DCB, keep `AggregateBasedEventStorageEngine`, etc.).
4. **Report** — render the report (see Queue flow § Render report).

MUST NOT:

- Run without all required parameters resolved to a supported value.
- Run multiple recipes in one invocation.
- Migrate more than the single source named by the user.
- Migrate anything outside the supported `(framework, configuration)` matrix — the rest of the codebase stays untouched.
- Introduce DCB or swap event storage engine.

### `project`

Migrate **everything in the working directory** that any recipe in the catalog declares applicable. `source` is ignored.

Steps (after the common pre-steps):

**Recipe loop** — iterate recipes in discovery order. For each recipe:

1. **Discover** — evaluate the recipe's `applicable` predicates across the codebase to produce candidate sources.
    - `execution=inline` → orchestrator scans inline using `Grep` / `Glob` / `Read`.
    - `execution=subagent` → dispatch one `Explore` subagent for this recipe. Read-only — no edits.
    - **Scan `.java` AND `.kt`, across all source roots.** JVM projects are mixed and Kotlin files often sit under `src/main/java/` (and vice-versa) — never filter candidates by extension or source directory. Key on the recipe's Axon annotations, not on path. See `DEFAULT.md § Source file conventions` (the `Explore` subagent must be told this too).
2. **Enqueue** — add `(recipe, source)` candidates. Deduplication is recipe's concern.
3. **Drain** — exhaust all pending items for **this recipe** before advancing to the next:
    - `max-subagents=0` (default) → inline, main session, sequentially.
    - `max-subagents=N` → main session acts as **coordinator**. Dispatches up to N pending items simultaneously as `general-purpose` subagents (single `Agent` message per batch). Each subagent executes ONE recipe sub-flow and returns a result block (`RESULT:` line + Notes + a `Learnings` field — complete authored entries, or an explicit `none — <why>`). The subagent **authors** the learning prose (it witnessed the run) but MUST NOT write `learnings.md` itself — the coordinator is the single safe writer under parallelism and stamps the date + commit sha, relaying each entry verbatim (see DURABILITY § Proactive Learnings).
      - ✅ Success / ⏭ Rejected / ❌ Failure → main records result, immediately dispatches next pending item. **No pause.**
      - 🚧 Blocker → **BLOCKER_RESOLUTION in main session**: `AskUserQuestion` if `auto=false`; auto-skip if `auto=true`. Resolved → re-dispatch same item to a new subagent. Not resolved → mark blocked, dispatch next pending item.
      - Main session never pauses unless waiting for user input on a blocker (`auto=false`).
      - **Fallback** — if a subagent cannot be spawned, process inline and continue.
4. **Mark recipe done** — `on:recipe-done` hook records status in `progress.md` Recipe status table.

After all recipes drained → **Debugging loop** → **Finalize** → **Report**.

**Context hygiene** — after every 5 items drained, emit this tip once (then reset counter):

> 💡 Context is growing. Run `/clear` and re-invoke the skill — it resumes automatically from `.axon4to5-migration/progress.md`, no work is lost.

MUST NOT:

- Spawn a subagent under `execution=inline`.
- Pass anything beyond `(recipe path, source, framework, configuration)` to a recipe subagent — context bloat defeats
  the parallelism win.
- Cross repository boundaries during discovery.
- Halt the queue on a single Failure — record and drain the rest.
- Introduce DCB or swap event storage engine.

## Queue flow

`$SOURCE` is referenced throughout the recipe sub-flow as the argument passed to the skill from `source`.

> `[[Execute recipe sub-flow]]` = [`references/recipes/FLOW.md`](references/recipes/FLOW.md), loaded at skill start. `[[Resolve blocker]]` = [`references/recipes/BLOCKER_RESOLUTION.md`](references/recipes/BLOCKER_RESOLUTION.md), budget = 1 attempt per item; on exhaustion item is marked blocked and drain continues.

**Discovery order** — Discover scans recipes in this fixed sequence. Aggregates first: they define the events and commands consumed by downstream types.

| # | Recipe (`id` per frontmatter `order:`) |
|---|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | `aggregate` |
| 2 | `event-processor` |
| 3 | `command-gateway` |
| 4 | `query-gateway` |
| 5 | `query-handler` |
| 6 | `interceptors` |
| 7 | `saga` |
| 8 | `event-store` |

## Debugging loop (project mode only)

Entered when drain empties but build is still red. All known recipes have been applied — this phase asks: "is there still something a recipe can fix?"

**Before the first full compile:** Scan for application classes in subdirectories that OpenRewrite does NOT process by default — e.g., a `microservices/` tree or separately deployable modules at the same repo root. These classes often use the same AF4 patterns (AF4 `ConfigurationEnhancer`, `SagaEntry`, `DeadlineManager`) as the main modules but are missed by the recipe drain because discovery only scanned the main source sets. Add any found classes to the queue and drain them before running the full compile.

1. **Full compile** — `mvn compile` / `gradle classes` (Java + Kotlin). Green → exit loop → Finalize.
2. Errors remain:
   - **Re-discover** — re-scan every recipe's `applicable` predicates against current codebase. Sources mutated during drain may now match recipes that rejected earlier.
   - New `(recipe, source)` pairs not already terminal → re-enqueue as `pending`, resume drain (loop repeats).
   - Nothing new → all applicable recipes exhausted → Finalize.

## Finalize (project mode only)

1. **Cleanup scaffolding** — `Grep` all `pom.xml` / `build.gradle(.kts)` for `isolated-*` Maven profiles and `isolated*` Gradle source-sets added by `axon4to5-isolatedtest`. `Edit` each build file to remove found blocks. Commit: `chore(af5): remove isolated-test scaffolding`. Skip if none found.
2. **Final compile** — full compile; record pass/fail + error count in `progress.md`. Commit: `chore(af5): record final compile status`.
3. **Count results** — group queue rows by recipe type × status (Success / Rejected / Failure / Blocked).
4. → Render report.

## Report format (project mode)

Emit this block to the user on `on:session-end`:

```
🏁 Migration complete — all applicable recipes exhausted.

| Recipe type     | ✅ Success | ⏭ Rejected | ❌ Failure | 🚧 Blocked |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| aggregate       |     N     |     N      |     N     |     N     |
| event-processor |     N     |     N      |     N     |     N     |
| …               |           |            |           |           |

Compilation: ✅ green
     — or —
Compilation: ⚠️ N error(s) remain — manual intervention required.

Blocked items (caller must resolve):
- <recipe>/<source>: <blocker notes>

See .axon4to5-migration/progress.md for full details.
```

## Recipe sub-flow

**Load order at skill start (before any pre-steps or mode logic):**
1. `Read` [`references/recipes/FLOW.md`](references/recipes/FLOW.md) — recipe control-flow spec. Non-optional. Recipes fill in named sections; they never re-implement it.
2. `Read` [`references/DURABILITY.md`](references/DURABILITY.md) — state + resume protocol (`mode=project`; skim for `mode=single`).

### Recipe defaults ([`DEFAULT.md`](references/recipes/DEFAULT.md))

**ALWAYS `Read` [`references/recipes/DEFAULT.md`](references/recipes/DEFAULT.md) BEFORE any per-recipe `RECIPE.md` under
[`references/recipes/`](references/recipes/).** It holds shared defaults for every named recipe section (`# Applicable`,
`# Scope`, `# References`, `# Success Criteria`, `# Blocker`, `# Toolbox`, `# Out of Scope`, `# Gotchas`).

Merge rule when executing a recipe:

- For each section the FLOW consults, start from [`DEFAULT.md`](references/recipes/DEFAULT.md)'s content for that
  section.
- If `RECIPE.md` defines the same section → **`RECIPE.md` overrides** (full section replacement, not append).
    - Exception: if `RECIPE.md`'s section body references [`DEFAULT.md`](references/recipes/DEFAULT.md) (e.g. literal
      token `@DEFAULT.md` or prose like "inherits from DEFAULT.md" / "extends DEFAULT.md") → **append** the recipe's
      content to the default's content for that section instead of replacing.
- If `RECIPE.md` omits the section → the [`DEFAULT.md`](references/recipes/DEFAULT.md) content stands.
- Recipe authors only write sections that differ from the default. No need to re-state defaults.

## References/Docs: Migration paths catalog

Shared cross-recipe knowledge base at [`references/docs/paths/`](references/docs/paths/). Recipes pick relevant entries
in their `### Migration Paths` subsection, each with an **apply-condition** (a fact about current scope that triggers
loading the file). The orchestrator never reads these directly — only recipes do, gated by their declared
apply-condition.

Catalog (one file per topic; `.adoc`):

| Path                                                                                                       | Topic                                               |
