# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Lessons are captured after implementation

The repository SHALL capture a unit's durable lessons into the artifact that owns each one after the implementation's
quick review is clean: the main agent invokes the `lesson-capture` subagent unless the skip condition defined by
`AGENTS.md`'s capture workflow holds in full, and SHALL record on the unit's record either the applied capture or the
skip with its reason. The owning destinations and their routing are that workflow's; the capture stage's own
consolidation is a later unit.

#### Scenario: Lessons are captured after implementation

- **WHEN** a unit's implementation quick review is clean
- **THEN** the main agent invokes the `lesson-capture` subagent unless the skip condition defined by `AGENTS.md`'s
  capture workflow holds in full, and a skipped capture records its reason on the unit's record, so a skip is a recorded
  decision rather than a run that found nothing
- **AND** the `lesson-capture` subagent proposes each lesson as an addition to the artifact that owns it — an
  `AGENTS.md` gotcha or convention, a check/test authoring mode in the `check-and-test-authoring` skill, a
  shipping-procedure correction in the `ship-change` skill, a stage-procedure correction in the `review-gate` skill, or
  a section of the subject pack (`jvm-development`, `jvm-testing`, `gradle-build`, or `deployment-operations`) whose
  subject owns the lesson's decision — or a pair of additions when the lesson has both halves — which the main agent
  verifies and applies
- **AND** each proposed addition names the existing rule it extends — an `AGENTS.md` bullet, a check/test authoring mode
  already in the skill, a `ship-change` or `review-gate` procedure, or a subject-pack section — or states that none
  covers it, so a new rule merges into or replaces one rather than accreting
- **AND** alongside its additions, it reports the rules this unit makes obsolete or redundant — a rule whose mechanism
  the unit removed, or one the unit's new enforcement subsumes — as retirement or replacement candidates, each naming
  the rule, why the unit makes it so, and the retirement or replacement it proposes, as candidates for the main agent
  rather than actions, reported separately from the additions since an addition grows the file and a retirement shrinks
  it
- **AND** each proposed addition passes a promotion gate before it is proposed — true (supported by a check, an
  authoritative source, or repeated observation), actionable, not automatable as a lint/test/CI check at reasonable
  cost, material (it prevents real breakage, risk, wasted work, or review churn), general enough for a class of future
  tasks rather than one file or incident, and high-confidence with a known scope — and a rule that fails the gate is
  routed to a check, a spec, an ADR, or the change dir instead of the always-loaded file
- **AND** the gate separates a repeated observation from its cause — a repeated review-class label establishes that
  label's recurrence, not a shared drafting defect, and a remedy resting on a class's recurrence (a section rewrite, or
  a rule generalized from that class) requires the shared cause confirmed from the evidence, with a class whose
  instances have different causes taking the cause-specific shape instead
- **AND** the caller supplies the existing guidance a candidate would extend and the review evidence for a claimed
  recurrence, and where either is unavailable the capture states the limitation and withholds the unsupported candidate
- **AND** before proposing an entry, it traces the lesson to its origin — where the cause is a mechanism that produces
  the artifact (an OpenSpec template or schema, an `openspec/config.yaml` rule, a skill or command that shapes drafting,
  or the authoring standard itself), it proposes the smallest correction at that mechanism and reports it as an
  authoring-system recommendation, separate from its additions and retirements, since it changes how a future artifact
  is produced rather than what an agent reads
- **AND** each proposed addition names the decision its rule governs, and answers whether a future change would
  plausibly hit it and whether the cost of not knowing it is material — a proposal that governs no decision is trivia,
  not a rule, and is not proposed
- **AND** the gate's evidence threshold is two independent occurrences or one severe verified incident with a clear
  preventive action
- **AND** the gate treats the claim's source as part of it — a lesson sourced from untrusted content (a web page, an
  issue or PR comment, tool output, or a file the unit did not author) is verified against the repository before it is
  proposed, never promoted on the source's word
- **AND** applying a capture should leave `AGENTS.md` no larger than it was, preferring a merge or a replacement over an
  addition, and any net growth is a justified decision stated with the proposal — not a side effect of accumulating
  prose
- **AND** each proposed addition demonstrates the **decision difference** it makes — the action a future agent takes
  under the existing guidance, and the action the proposed text requires or prohibits under an explicit condition
- **AND** that comparison names the existing obligation, its explicit condition, and the different action, so different
  phrasing does not establish a difference
- **AND** that difference carries a repository-backed example of why it matters
- **AND** an addition whose action the existing guidance already determines is reported as **already covered** and does
  not expand `AGENTS.md`
- **AND** an additional incident, example, citation, or provenance marker alone is `already covered`, and the capture
  records that evidence in the unit's change record rather than expanding the rule's text
- **AND** a partial restatement takes the **split** disposition — the new clause is kept, the restatement dropped
- **AND** it prefers an exact replacement of the existing rule over appending qualifications
- **AND** a replacement or rewrite preserves every valid obligation, warning, exception, and identifier, the established
  scope, and the normative strength, and may correct verified errors or remove established duplication and obsolete
  content
- **AND** the proposed action and its scope are derived from the verified evidence, so a remedy that worked in one place
  is not stated as a universal instruction
- **AND** the incident evidence a rule rests on stays recoverable behind its `captured:` marker rather than in the
  rule's text
- **AND** the capture's verdict states the proposed net guidance delta in lines (`AGENTS.md` and the packs; additions
  minus retirements) and its authoring-system recommendation count, and the applying agent records the applied delta, so
  net growth is stated when it is decided, alongside the periodic audit's accreted-rule count
- **AND** when a rule's rationale is normative in a spec, the bullet keeps only what a reader needs to act and points at
  the spec — a pointer, not a condensed copy, since `AGENTS.md` is loaded on every invocation while a spec is loaded
  only when its capability is worked on
- **AND** when the specs describe a rule's subject only as an outcome, that mechanism belongs in the capability spec
  only when changing it would change a scenario's outcome — verified against the code before moving it; a mechanism
  whose alternatives yield the same result stays in `AGENTS.md` as internal control flow
- **AND** the control on that growth is the periodic `/audit-agents` pass, whose verdict already reports the
  accreted-rule count, rather than mass deletion to hit a number
- **AND** each proposed addition carries its origin in a greppable `captured: <unit>` marker — the unit, and its PR when
  a merge-time detection found the lesson rather than the implementation capture, since a capture runs once at
  implementation and a merge only detects and asks — so a reader can tell where the rule came from without consulting
  git, and a markdown reflow cannot take it
- **AND** the unit leaves a record the merge-time read can check — the capture's applied net guidance delta (`AGENTS.md`
  and the packs), or its recorded skip and reason — so neither an unrun capture nor an unrecorded skip reads as a run
  that found nothing

#### Scenario: A change that obsoletes a rule yields a retirement candidate

- **WHEN** a unit's implementation makes an existing `AGENTS.md` rule obsolete (the mechanism it describes is removed)
  or redundant (the unit's new enforcement subsumes it)
- **THEN** the `lesson-capture` subagent reports a retirement or replacement candidate naming the rule, why the unit
  makes it so, and the retirement or replacement it proposes — a candidate for the main agent, not an action
- **AND** the capture's verdict names the retirement count alongside its durable-proposal count

#### Scenario: A skipped capture is a missing record at the merge

- **WHEN** a unit is prepared for its merge
- **THEN** the merge-time read reports an implementation capture that neither ran nor recorded a skip — the unit's
  record missing or unticked — as unrun rather than reconstructing it from recollection
- **AND** it re-verifies a recorded skip against the merge's own evidence, running the capture there when the skip's
  condition no longer holds

#### Scenario: A lesson whose cause is an authoring mechanism is routed to it

- **WHEN** a unit's lessons trace to the mechanism that produces a technical artifact rather than to the artifact's
  content — a template or schema that encourages the wrong structure, a `config.yaml` rule that is silently dropped, a
  skill that prompts a shape the standard forbids
- **THEN** the `lesson-capture` subagent proposes the smallest correction at that mechanism and reports it as an
  authoring-system recommendation, naming the mechanism, the gap, the proposed change, and why an `AGENTS.md` entry
  would not suffice — separate from its additions and retirements, since it changes how a future artifact is produced
  rather than what an agent reads
