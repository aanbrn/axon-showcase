## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Source formatting is enforced by the build

The build SHALL format Java and Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`) sources to a canonical style — including removal of unused
imports — and verify formatting as part of the standard `check` task, with no IDE required.

#### Scenario: Formatting check runs in the standard check

- **WHEN** the standard `check` task runs
- **THEN** it includes a formatting check for every module

#### Scenario: Unformatted source fails the build

- **WHEN** a source file does not conform to the canonical formatting
- **THEN** the formatting check fails and reports the offending file

#### Scenario: Unused import fails the build

- **WHEN** a Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`) source file contains an unused import
- **THEN** the formatting check fails and reports the offending file

#### Scenario: Formatting runs without an IDE

- **WHEN** the formatting check runs on a machine with no IDE installed
- **THEN** it executes entirely within the Gradle build
