## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The spec corpus is audited for structure and consistency

The repository SHALL provide a `specs-auditor` agent subagent that audits the `openspec/specs/` corpus for **structure
and consistency**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL cover, at least: each spec's `#`
title matching its capability path; each Purpose describing the requirements the spec holds; requirement-header and
requirement-body conventions (a declarative header, a SHALL body, WHEN/THEN scenarios); requirements duplicated or
near-duplicated across specs; and dead cross-references to renamed classes, files, or configuration the specs cite. The
audit SHALL NOT verify behavior against the implementation — that remains with the change workflow's review loop and the
archive-time spec sync. Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository, and SHALL be reported grouped by severity
with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. A requirement header reused across two genuinely different
capabilities SHALL be reported for judgment rather than treated as a defect. The subagent SHALL propose its findings
without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

#### Scenario: A spec-corpus audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `specs-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-specs` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering title/path match, Purpose fit, requirement conventions,
  cross-spec duplication, and dead cross-references, each with a location and a suggested rewrite

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent flags a title, cross-reference, or apparent duplicate
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the capability path, the referenced file or symbol, the bodies of
  the requirements involved) before reporting it, so a still-true title or a legitimately shared header is not reported
  as a defect

#### Scenario: Behavior drift is out of scope

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent audits the corpus
- **THEN** it does not verify requirement scenarios against the implementation, leaving behavior-vs-code drift to the
  change workflow's review loop and the archive-time spec sync

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves
