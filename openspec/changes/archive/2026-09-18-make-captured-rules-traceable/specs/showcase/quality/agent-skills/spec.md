## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-change quality-gate and analysis subagents are available

The repository SHALL provide locally-defined agent subagents under `.opencode/agent/` for the per-change quality gates
and analysis workflows — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents, and the visual and diagram agents — each
described by the scenarios below or by its own requirement in this capability. Each SHALL be invocable by the main
agent, with its purpose described in its agent definition and (where relevant) in `AGENTS.md`.

#### Scenario: Quick review runs after proposal and implementation

- **WHEN** a change's proposal (planning artifacts) or its implementation is finished
- **THEN** the `review-quick` subagent reviews it against the change's planning artifacts, and the loop repeats until it
  reports no new observations before a manual review is requested

#### Scenario: Thorough review is available on demand

- **WHEN** a deep review pass is wanted (drift, correctness, architecture, conventions)
- **THEN** the `review-thorough` subagent reviews the change against its delta specs, tasks, and the surrounding code

#### Scenario: Lessons are captured after implementation

- **WHEN** a change's implementation quick review is clean
- **THEN** the `lesson-capture` subagent proposes `AGENTS.md` gotchas/conventions from the change's lessons, which the
  main agent verifies and applies
- **AND** each proposed addition names the existing bullet it extends, or states that no bullet covers it — a new rule
  merges into or replaces one rather than accreting
- **AND** each proposed addition carries its origin in a greppable `captured: <change>` marker — the change for an
  implementation capture, the change and its PR for the post-merge capture — so a reader can tell where the rule came
  from without consulting git, and a markdown reflow cannot take it

#### Scenario: Screenshots are reviewed visually

- **WHEN** the main agent needs to inspect a screenshot, image, or visual UI state (e.g. web-UI styling)
- **THEN** the `vision` subagent reads the image and returns a description, so the text-only main agent can delegate
  visual review

#### Scenario: ASCII diagrams are drawn by the pro-model diagrammer

- **WHEN** a diagram needs to be created, aligned, or fixed (e.g. a README flow diagram)
- **THEN** the `diagrammer` subagent renders it with the pro model: it establishes the semantic mapping (which span
  starts and ends where), aligns by character width, and preserves deliberate asymmetry — so the cheap flash main agent
  does not spend effort on ASCII geometry

### Requirement: Project-owned agent tooling is audited for consistency and conciseness

The repository SHALL provide an `agents-auditor` agent subagent that audits the project-owned agent tooling —
`AGENTS.md` and the project-authored files under `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/commands/`, and `.opencode/skills/` —
for **consistency** and **conciseness**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL exclude files
the repository does not author: the generator-owned OpenSpec instruction files (the commands and skills written by
`openspec update`) and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills (copied verbatim from the upstream AxonIQ repository); a
project-authored file that shares a generated file's name prefix (e.g. the `opsx-tool-update` command) SHALL remain in
scope. The audit SHALL cover, at least: contradictions between entries or files, stale claims and enumerations the
repository has outgrown, dead cross-references, and drift from the code/workflows/specs the prose describes
(consistency); and duplicated or near-duplicate entries, one-off trivia, over-long or over-specific entries, and
misplaced entries (conciseness). Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the
prose alone, and SHALL be reported with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. The subagent SHALL propose its
findings without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **advisory** class kept separate from its fix findings and reported without
severity, third-party inconsistency: a file the audit excludes (a generated `openspec-*` instruction file, or a vendored
`axon4to5-*` skill) that contradicts how this repository uses it. The class SHALL be bounded by a harm test — reported
only where the contradiction would mislead a workflow driven by the file, or instruct a pattern the repository's code or
conventions contradict, never a mere textual difference from the repository's own prose. Each item SHALL name the harm
and the decision it invites (report it upstream, re-vendor at a newer version, or change the repository's usage) and
SHALL NOT propose a local edit to the excluded file, which the exclusion rule forbids.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **accretion** class kept separate from both its fix findings and its advisory
class, the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product — a rule about the agent, its tooling, the per-change
workflow, or the documentation, as opposed to a fact about the product. Each item SHALL name the rule, the origin that
introduced it (established from the in-prose `captured:` marker where present, and from `git blame` / `git log -S`
otherwise), and the source used to establish it. The class SHALL be reported without severity and is not a defect: an
accreted rule may be correct and load-bearing, so the audit SHALL NOT propose removing or merging it — that is the
user's decision on the report.

#### Scenario: An agent-tooling audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `agents-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-agents` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering consistency (contradictions, stale claims, dead
  cross-references, drift) and conciseness (duplication, trivia, length, placement) across `AGENTS.md` and the
  project-authored `.opencode/` files, each with a location and a suggested rewrite — plus, separately, any advisory
  third-party inconsistency and the accreted meta rules with their origins

#### Scenario: Generated and vendored files are excluded

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent selects what to audit
- **THEN** it excludes the OpenSpec instruction files written by `openspec update` and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills,
  whose correct state is defined by their generator or upstream rather than by this repository — while a
  project-authored file with a similar name (the `opsx-tool-update` command) stays in scope

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent flags a claim, enumeration, or cross-reference
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the referenced files, workflows, or specs) before reporting it,
  so a deliberate or still-true entry is not reported as stale

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

#### Scenario: An excluded file inconsistent with our usage is reported as advisory

- **WHEN** an excluded file (a generated instruction file or a vendored skill) contradicts how this repository uses it —
  for example a vendored migration skill instructing a pattern the codebase no longer follows
- **THEN** the audit reports it in a separate advisory class, naming the harm and the decision it invites (report
  upstream, re-vendor, or change our usage), and never proposes a local edit to that file

#### Scenario: A mere textual difference is not reported

- **WHEN** an excluded file differs from the repository's own prose but would not mislead a workflow or instruct a
  contradicted pattern
- **THEN** the audit does not report it, so the advisory class stays limited to contradictions that would change what a
  reader does

#### Scenario: Accreted meta rules are reported with their origin

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product as a separate accretion class, each with the
  origin that introduced it (the `captured:` marker where present, `git blame` / `git log -S` otherwise) and the source
  used, without proposing that the rule be removed or merged

### Requirement: Report-producing subagents follow a shared report contract

Every subagent that reports findings to the main agent — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents and the
on-demand auditors of the agent tooling, the spec corpus, and the architecture — SHALL follow one shared output
contract, so a report is skimmable and its verdict is read first. The contract SHALL bound the report, not the analysis:
a subagent SHALL verify its claims as thoroughly as before and report them in the contract's shape.

#### Scenario: A report opens with its verdict

- **WHEN** a report-producing subagent returns its findings
- **THEN** the first line states the outcome — whether anything remains and how many items — and names the count of
  every class the report carries (findings, and any advisory or accretion class it reports)
- **AND** a report with nothing to report says so in that first line rather than in a closing sentence

#### Scenario: Each item is budgeted

- **WHEN** the subagent reports a proposed addition, a finding, or an observation
- **THEN** the item names itself, its anchor (`file:line` where applicable), and one line of evidence
- **AND** the budget is per item, not a cap on the report's total, so a report with many genuine findings is longer than
  one with few

#### Scenario: Verified-and-set-aside candidates are summarized

- **WHEN** the subagent has verified a candidate and concluded it is already covered, rejected, or not a defect
- **THEN** it reports that in one line, or collapses several into one summary line, rather than a paragraph each

#### Scenario: No alternatives are offered

- **WHEN** the subagent proposes a change or a correction
- **THEN** it states the recommendation, not a menu of alternatives — the calling agent makes the choice
