## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project-owned agent tooling is audited for consistency and conciseness

The repository SHALL provide an `agents-auditor` agent subagent that audits the project-owned agent tooling —
`AGENTS.md` and the project-authored files under `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/commands/`, and `.opencode/skills/` —
for **consistency** and **conciseness**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL exclude files
the repository does not author: the generator-owned OpenSpec instruction files (the commands and skills written by
`openspec update`) and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills (copied verbatim from the upstream AxonIQ repository); a
project-authored file that shares a generated file's name prefix (e.g. the `opsx-tool-update` command) SHALL remain in
scope. The audit SHALL cover, at least: contradictions between entries or files, stale claims and enumerations the
repository has outgrown, dead cross-references, and drift from the code/workflows/specs the prose describes
(consistency); and duplicated or near-duplicate entries, one-off trivia, over-long or over-specific entries, and
misplaced entries (conciseness). Within conciseness the audit SHALL report two analyses as standing findings rather than
only under a scoped run: **merge candidates**, each naming the overlapping or complementary entries and the merged text
that preserves every anchor and piece of evidence the originals carried — and never blending two distinct lessons into
one — and where the merged text would only restate a rule the file already carries, the candidate is a deletion of the
duplicate rather than a merge, reported as a `remove` so the verdict's count includes it, and the audit SHALL say which
it is; and **removal candidates**, each naming a rule that governs no decision (trivia, not a rule — the same test the
capture's filter applies), what would be lost, and whether git preserves it. Both are candidates for the owner, not
actions. Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the prose alone, and SHALL be
reported with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. The subagent SHALL propose its findings without modifying
files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **advisory** class kept separate from its fix findings and reported without
severity, third-party inconsistency: a file the audit excludes (a generated `openspec-*` instruction file, or a vendored
`axon4to5-*` skill) that contradicts how this repository uses it. The class SHALL be bounded by a harm test — reported
only where the contradiction would mislead a workflow driven by the file, or instruct a pattern the repository's code or
conventions contradict, never a mere textual difference from the repository's own prose. Each item SHALL name the harm
and the decision it invites (report it upstream, re-vendor at a newer version, or change the repository's usage) and
SHALL NOT propose a local edit to the excluded file, which the exclusion rule forbids.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **accretion** class kept separate from both its fix findings and its advisory
class, the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product — a rule about the agent, its tooling, the per-change
workflow, or the documentation, as opposed to a fact about the product. Each item SHALL name the rule, the origin that
introduced it (established from the in-prose `captured:` marker where present, and from `git blame` / `git log -S`
otherwise), and the source used to establish it. The class SHALL be reported without severity and is not a defect: an
accreted rule may be correct and load-bearing, so the audit SHALL NOT propose removing or merging it for being meta — a
meta rule that governs no decision is a removal candidate under the conciseness analysis, not a victim of its class —
that is the user's decision on the report.

#### Scenario: An agent-tooling audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `agents-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-agents` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering consistency (contradictions, stale claims, dead
  cross-references, drift) and conciseness (duplication, trivia, length, placement) across `AGENTS.md` and the
  project-authored `.opencode/` files, each with a location and a suggested rewrite — plus, separately, any advisory
  third-party inconsistency, the accreted meta rules with their origins, with the merge and removal candidate counts
  named in the verdict line

#### Scenario: Generated and vendored files are excluded

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent selects what to audit
- **THEN** it excludes the OpenSpec instruction files written by `openspec update` and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills,
  whose correct state is defined by their generator or upstream rather than by this repository — while a
  project-authored file with a similar name (the `opsx-tool-update` command) stays in scope

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent flags a claim, enumeration, or cross-reference
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the referenced files, workflows, or specs) before reporting it,
  so a deliberate or still-true entry is not reported as stale

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

#### Scenario: An excluded file inconsistent with our usage is reported as advisory

- **WHEN** an excluded file (a generated instruction file or a vendored skill) contradicts how this repository uses it —
  for example a vendored migration skill instructing a pattern the codebase no longer follows
- **THEN** the audit reports it in a separate advisory class, naming the harm and the decision it invites (report
  upstream, re-vendor, or change our usage), and never proposes a local edit to that file

#### Scenario: A mere textual difference is not reported

- **WHEN** an excluded file differs from the repository's own prose but would not mislead a workflow or instruct a
  contradicted pattern
- **THEN** the audit does not report it, so the advisory class stays limited to contradictions that would change what a
  reader does

#### Scenario: Accreted meta rules are reported with their origin

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product as a separate accretion class, each with the
  origin that introduced it (the `captured:` marker where present, `git blame` / `git log -S` otherwise) and the source
  used, without proposing that the rule be removed or merged for being meta

#### Scenario: Merge and removal candidates are standing findings

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports merge candidates (with a merged text that preserves every anchor and piece of evidence the
  originals carried, and never blending two distinct lessons — or, where that text would only restate a rule the file
  already carries, a deletion of the duplicate, still counted as a `remove`, saying which) and removal candidates (rules
  that govern no decision — trivia, not a rule — with what would be lost and whether git preserves it) — as findings for
  the owner, not actions
