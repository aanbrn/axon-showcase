## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review-round rows record the reviewer session's continuity

The build SHALL verify that the review-round ledger records, for every row below the boundary its own contract marks,
the reviewer session the round ran in — its identifier, its transition, and, for a replacement, a reason the review
loop's recovery cases allow or `caller-restarted` for a restart already performed without an evidenced recovery case (a
violation record, not a recovery case) — and that no row above it carries a field count other than the ledger's
pre-fields width. The verification SHALL be a `commit-hygiene.py` mode run by a `check` task over the tracked ledger.

#### Scenario: The standard check verifies reviewer-session continuity

- **WHEN** the standard `check` task runs
- **THEN** it includes the reviewer-session continuity verification

#### Scenario: A unit's first row records a created session

- **WHEN** a unit's first row below the boundary carries a session identifier with the `created` transition
- **THEN** the continuity verification passes for that unit

#### Scenario: Consecutive rounds sharing one session pass

- **WHEN** a unit's later row records the same session identifier as its preceding row, with the `continued` transition
- **THEN** the continuity verification passes for that unit

#### Scenario: A repeated identifier with a transition other than continued fails the check

- **WHEN** a row records the same session identifier as its preceding row, with a transition other than `continued`
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit, the round, and the identifier

#### Scenario: A padded identifier names the same session as its trimmed form

- **WHEN** a row's identifier carries surrounding whitespace and its preceding row's identifier is the same value
  trimmed
- **THEN** the continuity verification treats them as one session, so the row continues it

#### Scenario: An allowed replacement passes with its reason

- **WHEN** a unit's row records a different session identifier from its preceding row, with the `replaced` transition
  and one of the three recovery reasons — `expired`, `definition-changed`, or `stopped-responding`
- **THEN** the continuity verification passes for that unit

#### Scenario: An unexplained session change fails the check

- **WHEN** a unit's row records a different session identifier from its preceding row without the `replaced` transition
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit, the round, and both identifiers

#### Scenario: A replacement without an allowed reason fails the check

- **WHEN** a row records the `replaced` transition whose reason is absent or is not one of the recorded reasons
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit, the round, and the reason

#### Scenario: A reason on a non-replacement row fails the check

- **WHEN** a row whose transition is `created` or `continued` carries a replacement reason
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit, the round, and the reason

#### Scenario: A row whose field count is not the ledger's width fails the check

- **WHEN** a row below the ledger's boundary comment carries more or fewer fields than the contract declares
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the row and its field count

#### Scenario: A transition outside the three fails the check

- **WHEN** a row below the boundary carries a transition that is not `created`, `continued`, or `replaced`
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit, the round, and the value

#### Scenario: A row with no session identifier fails the check

- **WHEN** a row below the ledger's boundary comment carries no session identifier
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the row

#### Scenario: A first row that is not a creation fails the check

- **WHEN** a unit's first row below the boundary comment carries a transition other than `created`
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, naming the unit and its round

#### Scenario: A row above the boundary whose field count is not the pre-fields width fails the check

- **WHEN** a row above the ledger's boundary comment carries a field count other than the one the ledger's rows carried
  before the session fields existed
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, stating that the boundary was moved past the row

#### Scenario: Rows above the boundary are exempt

- **WHEN** the ledger carries rows above its boundary comment, which predate the session fields
- **THEN** the continuity verification does not require the session fields on those rows

#### Scenario: A missing boundary comment fails the check

- **WHEN** the ledger carries no boundary comment marking the first row to carry the session fields
- **THEN** the continuity verification fails, stating that the boundary is absent

#### Scenario: Distinct units may start with distinct sessions

- **WHEN** two units' first rows record different session identifiers, each with the `created` transition
- **THEN** the continuity verification passes for both

#### Scenario: An already-performed caller restart is recorded without inventing a recovery cause

- **WHEN** a different reviewer session was already started without an evidenced recovery case
- **THEN** its row records `replaced` with `caller-restarted`
- **AND** the record identifies the continuity violation and its correction
- **AND** accepting that record does not authorize another restart

`caller-restarted` SHALL record a continuity violation, not an additional permitted recovery case; the verification
SHALL validate the recorded fields, and passing it SHALL NOT attest that the stated cause occurred or authorize the
review gate to continue.

### Requirement: Review-round ledger rows are unique

The build SHALL verify that the review-round ledger (`docs/review-rounds.tsv`) carries **at most one row per unit and
round**, failing when the same `(unit, round)` pair appears twice, so a duplicated row cannot double-count a round in
the retrospective figures aggregated from it. The same verification SHALL also fail when a unit's rounds are not
contiguous from `1` to its highest round, and — when the caller names a round whose report has just arrived
(`--expect <unit>:<round>`, repeatable) — when that row is absent, so a deferred append is caught in the same turn
rather than by the next reviewer; a gap whose record is unrecoverable SHALL be acknowledged by a comment line in the
ledger naming the unit and the round, and only an acknowledged gap SHALL pass. An expectation the mode cannot parse, an
expectation given without the mode, and a ledger row whose round column is not a number SHALL each fail rather than
skip. The verification SHALL be a `commit-hygiene.py` mode run by a `check` task, reading the tracked ledger rather than
the staged set.

#### Scenario: A duplicated round row fails the check

- **WHEN** `check` runs and the ledger carries two rows with the same unit and round
- **THEN** the check fails, naming the unit, the round, and both line numbers

#### Scenario: One row per round passes

- **WHEN** every `(unit, round)` pair appears at most once, each unit's rounds are contiguous from `1` apart from
  acknowledged gaps, and every round the caller passed with `--expect` is recorded
- **THEN** the check passes

#### Scenario: A gap in a unit's rounds fails the check

- **WHEN** `check` runs and a unit's recorded rounds are `1, 2, 4`
- **THEN** the check fails, naming the unit and the missing round `3`

#### Scenario: The round whose report arrived is not recorded

- **WHEN** the caller runs the verification expecting `<unit>:3` and the ledger records that unit only through round `2`
- **THEN** the check fails, naming the unit and the expected round, even though its recorded rounds are contiguous

#### Scenario: An acknowledged gap passes

- **WHEN** a gap's record is unrecoverable and the ledger carries an acknowledgement comment naming the unit and the
  round
- **THEN** the check passes, and a gap without such an acknowledgement still fails

#### Scenario: An unparseable or mode-less expectation fails rather than skips

- **WHEN** the verification is run with an expectation that is not `<unit>:<round>`, or with an expectation and no
  `--unique-rounds`
- **THEN** it fails with a message naming what was wrong, rather than skipping the assertion

#### Scenario: A non-numeric round fails rather than being skipped

- **WHEN** a ledger row's round column is present but not a number
- **THEN** the check fails, naming the unit and the value, rather than ignoring the row

#### Scenario: A misfiled deep pass is acknowledged without a data row

- **WHEN** a historical number was assigned incorrectly to a deep-review pass whose authoritative record moved to the
  change's review task
- **THEN** an `# --- Acknowledged gap:` comment names the unit, the original number, and the destination
- **AND** no quick-review data row is created for that number
