## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The deep review is routed and bounded

The repository SHALL make one routing decision per unit before any deep-review session is created, resolving to
`REQUIRED`, `RECOMMENDED`, or `NOT_NEEDED`, and SHALL run the `review-thorough` subagent on an outcome that selects it.
The decision's deterministic floor is `scripts/review-routing.py`'s; the pass's procedure and hand-over are
`/review-thorough`'s; the reviewer's dimensions, evidence, and grouping are its definition's; the routed pass's status
is recorded on the change's review task.

#### Scenario: Thorough review is available on demand

- **WHEN** a deep review pass is wanted (drift, correctness, architecture, conventions) — a manual `/review-thorough`
  invocation, or an outcome the deep-review routing decision below selects
- **THEN** the `review-thorough` subagent reviews the change against its delta specs, tasks, and the surrounding code,
  proportionately to the risk the decision's outcome names
- **AND** it inspects the dimensions `review-thorough.md` defines, at the depth that risk names
- **AND** every finding it raises identifies a concrete defect or material risk, cites repository evidence and a precise
  location, explains the consequence, gives a corrective direction, and distinguishes a confirmed defect from an
  uncertainty — never a preference, a speculation, or a second instance of a root cause it already reported
- **AND** a manual `/review-thorough` invocation is an explicit run: it is never a substitute for a `REQUIRED` outcome,
  and it does not route

#### Scenario: Deep review is routed by one three-outcome decision

- **WHEN** a unit's implementation is complete and its quick-review loop has run
- **THEN** one routing decision is made before any deep-review session is created, from the completed implementation,
  the diff, the applicable planning artifacts, and the existing review evidence, and it resolves to exactly one of
  `REQUIRED` (a deep review must run before completion), `RECOMMENDED` (elevated risk or uncertainty requires an
  explicit recorded resolution), or `NOT_NEEDED` (the change is clearly low risk and may bypass deep review)
- **AND** `REQUIRED` covers a material change to a public contract, a cross-component boundary, an Axon
  command/event/aggregate/saga/projection, persistence or a migration, a transaction, a retry, idempotency, concurrency,
  ordering, reactive behavior, security, infrastructure, deployment, or an operational failure mode, a major
  specification deviation, and a unit whose recorded rounds show a material defect an earlier review missed
- **AND** `RECOMMENDED` covers credible but non-mandatory risk — a complex invariant, an ambiguous material requirement,
  a broad interaction, substantial design uncertainty, or a plausible defect quick review and the tests are unlikely to
  find — and it is resolved explicitly from evidence rather than escalated or skipped by default
- **AND** `NOT_NEEDED` applies only where the change is localized, low risk, and adequately verified, and never on a
  criterion of line count, changed-file count, or the build agent's own confidence alone — a documentation-only,
  formatting-only, or mechanical change is an example of the class, not an unconditional exemption
- **AND** the decision has a deterministic floor derived from the change's own facts — its changed paths and the
  declarations in its diff, its delta spec's requirement-block kinds, and its recorded rounds — so the decision is
  explainable and reproducible rather than an unaided judgment, and the agent's decision is at or above that floor and
  records the signals it relied on
- **AND** a diff whose changed-path set is non-empty and holds only Markdown record artifacts under
  `docs/process-defects/`, `docs/retrospectives/`, or `docs/load-tests/`, or the ledger path the invocation reads, SHALL
  NOT have its floor raised by the repeated-class signal alone when its derivation succeeded
- **AND** the classification SHALL be conservative: another file type or location keeps normal routing, and a rename is
  judged by both its source and its destination
- **AND** the suppressed signal SHALL be reported wherever the exemption applies, and a mandatory signal, a failed
  derivation, or the agent's own evidence still decides
- **AND** the rationale is that such a unit ships no behavior to converge on, so a repeated class is not by itself
  evidence of an unreviewed defect
- **AND** the decision is reassessed only when material new evidence changes the risk

#### Scenario: A missing or failed routing decision cannot skip mandatory review

- **WHEN** the routing decision is absent, malformed, or its derivation fails
- **THEN** the outcome is `REQUIRED` rather than a silent bypass, so an unreadable or failed decision can only make
  review run, never skip it

#### Scenario: A low-risk change bypasses the deep-review lifecycle

- **WHEN** the routing decision resolves to `NOT_NEEDED`
- **THEN** no deep-review session is created, no hand-over is prepared, and no expensive-model invocation is made, while
  the mandatory quick review, the tests, and the manual approval still run

#### Scenario: A routed deep review runs in its own session with a task-relevant hand-over

- **WHEN** the routing decision requires or recommends a deep review and the owner resolves to run it
- **THEN** one dedicated `review-thorough` session is created for that change, its supported session identifier and
  review state are preserved, and it is handed only the task-relevant context `/review-thorough`'s procedure names
- **AND** the build agent, the quick reviewer, and the deep reviewer stay in separate sessions
- **AND** a follow-up pass on that change reuses the same deep-reviewer session, while a different change starts a fresh
  one
- **AND** the deep reviewer inspects the current state independently on every follow-up, because session continuity is
  not proof that a fix is correct
- **AND** its scope is the change's artifacts and the checks its own contract names rather than the repository at large,
  and a question its evidence cannot settle within that scope is reported as a limitation rather than pursued
  indefinitely — so a deep pass returns its best completed report rather than treating uncertainty as a reason for
  unbounded investigation

#### Scenario: A failed deep-review hand-over is detected, not reported as a review

- **WHEN** creating the session, handing over, continuing it, parsing its output, or validating it fails
- **THEN** the failure is detected and reported rather than treated as a successful review, reusing the loop's existing
  recovery where it applies
- **AND** where the session must be replaced, the current findings, their statuses, the diff, and the objective are
  transferred to the replacement, the lost continuity is recorded, and the current state is reviewed independently
- **AND** where no safe recovery is available, the unit stops and reports the blocker

#### Scenario: Deep review is bounded by a two-pass budget

- **WHEN** a routed deep review runs
- **THEN** its pass budget is the one `/review-thorough` defines
- **AND** a targeted re-review may verify a localized fix and its impact radius, and it does not conceal an unresolved
  material finding

#### Scenario: A deep-review finding is tracked to a resolved status

- **WHEN** a deep-review pass raises a finding
- **THEN** it is tracked by a stable identifier where the reviewer supports one, or otherwise by a stable root cause,
  description, and location mapping, and its status is distinguished as `OPEN`, `FIXED_AND_VERIFIED`, `REJECTED` with
  the evidence for the rejection, or `ACCEPTED` only by an explicit owner decision recorded with the reason and what it
  accepts
- **AND** the status has one authoritative record rather than a copy in several artifacts, and the quick loop's round
  ledger stays its own record, so a deep pass does not change the population the loop's trend is read from

#### Scenario: Deep review exhausts a class it raises

- **WHEN** a deep-review pass raises a finding that falls in a class
- **THEN** it searches the change's artifacts for every instance of that class's shape and reports them as one clustered
  finding, so a class surfaces whole in the deep pass rather than one instance per quick-review round

#### Scenario: A record-only diff is not lifted by repeated classes

- **WHEN** a unit's changed-path set is non-empty and holds only Markdown record artifacts or the review-round ledger,
  its derivation succeeded, and its recorded rounds repeat a class
- **THEN** the routing floor is `NOT_NEEDED`, with the repeated-class signal and the record-only exemption both reported
- **AND** the agent may still decide above the floor on other evidence, while a mandatory path, a requirement block, a
  declaration, or a failed derivation still resolves to `REQUIRED` before the exemption is considered

### Requirement: The quick review loop runs on every unit

The repository SHALL run the bounded quick review after a unit's proposal and after its implementation, repeating until
it reports no new observations. The reviewer's screen, finding classes, evidence rules, report contract, and capture
challenge are its definition's; the caller's steps — the pre-write record, the claims table, the session preflight, the
ledger row and its checkpoint — are the review-gate skill's; the ledger row's format and verification are
`showcase/quality/commit-hygiene`'s.

A replacement reviewer session SHALL be started only after one of the recovery cases the review gate's rule names is
evidenced; an independent screen is not a recovery case, and a session change without an evidenced case is recorded as a
continuity violation rather than as a permitted replacement.

#### Scenario: Quick review runs after proposal and implementation

- **WHEN** a unit's proposal (planning artifacts) or its implementation is finished
- **THEN** the `review-quick` subagent reviews it against the unit's planning artifacts, and the loop repeats until it
  reports no new observations before a manual review is requested
- **AND** the pass is a bounded screen over the inputs the caller supplies — the screen `review-quick.md` defines — so a
  repository-wide search is not part of it, and its report states that scope and stop condition rather than implying
  unlimited analysis
- **AND** the caller supplies the screen's inputs as a list its report names, and for a capture that list includes the
  existing rules each proposal claims to extend (or its statement that none covers it), the capture evidence, and the
  `lesson-capture` definition
- **AND** a risk the supplied scope cannot settle is escalated to the deep review — through the routing decision or by
  the caller raising it — rather than absorbed by widening the pass
- **AND** the screen, the finding classification, each class's evidence requirement, the report contract, and the review
  of a capture's proposals against the capture contract are `review-quick.md`'s, while the caller's steps — the
  pre-write record, the claims table, the session preflight, the ledger row, and its checkpoint — are the `review-gate`
  skill's
- **AND** a defect the applying command rewrites — `spotlessApply`, or the web module's `npmFormat` — is routed to that
  command rather than reported, so what the command leaves alone stays reportable
- **AND** for a record artifact (a retrospective, a load-test record, or a process-defect record), a later round raising
  only new instances of an already-raised class stops and escalates to the owner rather than iterating, since such an
  artifact has no shipped behavior to converge on

#### Scenario: A stalled reviewer is replaced from a recorded handover

- **WHEN** a reviewer invocation has not responded by the deadline the caller's policy supplies
- **THEN** the caller records the failure as `stopped-responding`, naming the stalled session's identifier and its
  replacement's, and creates the replacement session only after that record
- **AND** the only cases that justify a replacement are: the prior session expired, the reviewer's definition changed
  after that session began, or the reviewer stopped responding mid-round (the loop has observed a session stall with no
  reply, which no wait resolves)
- **AND** the handover it gives the replacement is the record it wrote **before** waiting — the unit's identity, its
  base and current revisions, the unit's assigned working tree and branch, the supplied artifacts, the scope, the prior
  findings with their instance-level evidence, the completed checks, and the known limitations — so the context a
  replacement needs never depends on the stalled invocation reporting, and cancelling it loses no progress that record
  does not already hold
- **AND** the deadline comes from the invocation or the caller's policy, never a universal figure stated as a measured
  fact, because no measurement of a reviewer's duration is reproducible from the repository
- **AND** the replacement reviews the current state independently, treating the handover as context rather than as proof
  that a result is correct, and re-derives what it reports from the state it inspects
- **AND** the record keeps only facts the caller can verify — the replacement's reason, both session identifiers, the
  handover, and the round's outcome — and never a duration, a token count, or a session count asserted as a measurement,
  so the ledger trends what a gate can re-derive rather than a figure it cannot

#### Scenario: A skipped pre-write pass is a missing record

- **WHEN** a unit's planning artifacts are finished and the review loop is about to start
- **THEN** the unit's record names the pre-write derivation pass it ran — the change's `tasks.md` task, or the
  pull-request checklist line for a unit with no change dir — so a pass that was skipped is reported as that record
  missing or unticked rather than reconstructed from recollection

#### Scenario: An escalated record unit is not cleared by the stop

- **WHEN** a record artifact's later round raises only new instances of an already-raised class and the loop escalates
  to the owner
- **THEN** the finding-bearing ledger row and the finding instances are preserved, and the owner's decision is recorded
  on the unit's review task or pull-request review record
- **AND** the loop resumes per that decision without a manufactured clean round, and the stop is not clearance: the unit
  does not proceed to delivery while its highest recorded round still carries a finding class
