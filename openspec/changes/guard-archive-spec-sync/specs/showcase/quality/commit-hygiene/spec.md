# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A pre-commit guard blocks a mechanically defective staged set

The repository SHALL provide a tracked git `pre-commit` hook that inspects the staged set before a commit is created and
refuses the commit when it detects a mechanically defective state: the project's formatter check fails; a staged path is
a generated artifact that must not be committed; a path is staged and then modified again so the index no longer matches
the working tree; a staged file carries a merge conflict marker; a `captured:` marker is misplaced in a staged
`AGENTS.md`; or a change dir under `openspec/changes/archive/**` is staged while the spec sync `openspec archive` wrote
under `openspec/specs/**` is left unstaged or untracked. The hook SHALL name each offending path and the reason and
SHALL exit non-zero. The hook's path parsing SHALL be quote-safe: every path it reads from git SHALL be the real path
rather than git's C-quoted rendering, so a path containing non-ASCII bytes is inspected exactly like any other and no
check is silently skipped for it.

#### Scenario: A failing formatter check refuses the commit

- **WHEN** the project's formatter check fails while a formatter-owned file is staged
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and reports the formatter check's failure

#### Scenario: A force-staged generated artifact refuses the commit

- **WHEN** a generated artifact that the repository excludes (for example a Python bytecode file or a build output) is
  staged
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and names the offending path

#### Scenario: A path staged and then edited refuses the commit

- **WHEN** a path is staged and then modified again so the index and the working tree differ for that path
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and names the path

#### Scenario: A clean staged rename is not reported

- **WHEN** a path is renamed and staged with no further modification (`git mv`, nothing edited afterwards)
- **THEN** the guard does not report the rename as a path staged and then edited, and names no spurious path from the
  rename's old name

#### Scenario: A staged conflict marker refuses the commit

- **WHEN** a staged file carries a merge conflict branch marker
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and names the offending file and line

#### Scenario: A misplaced captured marker refuses the commit

- **WHEN** a staged `AGENTS.md` carries a `captured:` marker that is not inside a rule block (for example one sitting on
  a plain `- Text` bullet)
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and names the offending marker's location

#### Scenario: A clean staged set proceeds

- **WHEN** the staged set carries none of the detected defects
- **THEN** the guard passes and the commit proceeds

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII path is inspected rather than skipped

- **WHEN** a staged path contains non-ASCII bytes
- **THEN** the guard reads the real path rather than git's quoted rendering, so every check treats that path exactly as
  it would an ASCII path instead of skipping it

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII formatter-owned file reaches the formatter check

- **WHEN** a staged formatter-owned file has a non-ASCII name (e.g. `café.md`)
- **THEN** it is selected for the formatter check, so its formatting is verified rather than silently passed

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII generated artifact is refused

- **WHEN** a staged path that the repository excludes (a generated artifact) has a non-ASCII name
- **THEN** the guard reports it as a force-staged artifact and refuses the commit, so the escape check completes for a
  non-ASCII path as it would for an ASCII one

#### Scenario: A non-ASCII path staged and then edited is refused

- **WHEN** a non-ASCII path is staged and then modified again so the index and the working tree differ for it
- **THEN** the guard names that path and refuses the commit

#### Scenario: An unpaired archive move refuses the commit

- **WHEN** a change dir under `openspec/changes/archive/**` that carries delta specs is staged while the spec sync
  `openspec archive` wrote under `openspec/specs/**` is left unstaged or untracked
- **THEN** the guard refuses the commit and names the archived change and the un-staged spec paths

#### Scenario: A no-delta archive move requires no spec sync

- **WHEN** a change dir under `openspec/changes/archive/**` with no delta specs (a `skip_specs` change) is staged
- **THEN** the guard does not require a spec sync and does not report the archive move
