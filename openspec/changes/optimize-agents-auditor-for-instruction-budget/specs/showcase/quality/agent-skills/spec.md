## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project-owned agent tooling is audited for consistency and conciseness

The repository SHALL provide an `agents-auditor` agent subagent that audits the project-owned agent tooling —
`AGENTS.md` and the project-authored files under `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/commands/`, and `.opencode/skills/` —
for **consistency** and **conciseness**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL exclude files
the repository does not author: the generator-owned OpenSpec instruction files (the commands and skills written by
`openspec update`) and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills (copied verbatim from the upstream AxonIQ repository); a
project-authored file that shares a generated file's name prefix (e.g. the `opsx-tool-update` command) SHALL remain in
scope. The audit SHALL cover, at least: contradictions between entries or files, stale claims and enumerations the
repository has outgrown, dead cross-references, and drift from the code/workflows/specs the prose describes
(consistency); and duplicated or near-duplicate entries, one-off trivia, over-long or over-specific entries, and
misplaced entries (conciseness). Within conciseness the audit SHALL report these analyses as standing findings rather
than only under a scoped run: **merge candidates**, each naming the overlapping or complementary entries and the merged
text that preserves every anchor and piece of evidence the originals carried — and never blending two distinct lessons
into one — and where the merged text would only restate a rule the file already carries, the candidate is a deletion of
the duplicate rather than a merge, reported as a `remove` so the verdict's count includes it, and the audit SHALL say
which it is; **removal candidates**, each naming a rule that governs no decision (trivia, not a rule — the same test the
capture's filter applies), what would be lost, and whether git preserves it; and **route candidates**, each naming a
rule whose subject a deterministic mechanism already enforces — a build or CI gate, a lint or test, a CLI validation, or
a deterministic workflow step such as the archive-time spec sync, but never a review, whether a human's or a review
subagent's — and proposing to reduce the rule to a pointer at that mechanism, or move its content to the spec or ADR
that owns it, naming the mechanism, what would be lost, and confirming the mechanism exists and covers the rule's
subject; and **extraction candidates**, each a verified proposal to partition one `AGENTS.md` unit into a minimal
retained root entry point, an authoritative destination that loads or is discoverable when its trigger occurs, and an
explicit retrieval path from that trigger to that destination, as the conditions below define. All are candidates for
the owner, not actions. Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the prose alone,
and SHALL be reported with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. A reduction candidate — a merge, removal,
route, or extraction — SHALL carry seven fields: its location; the decision its rule changes; the task or condition that
requires it; the unique content the change would otherwise lose (every imperative, warning, exception, identifier,
rationale, provenance marker, and verification); its current loading cost; its disposition; and the repository evidence
that the surviving guidance preserves the same obligation. A merge candidate whose merged text delegates content to a
target — a spec or an ADR it points the reader to — SHALL have that delegation verified against the target: its behavior
**and** the identifiers, declarations, and gate conditions the delegated content names, not the behavior alone. A
delegated item the target does not carry SHALL stay in the merged text, and the candidate SHALL say which items it kept
for that reason. The subagent SHALL propose its findings without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies
those the user approves.

The audit SHALL additionally report an **instruction-budget ledger** for `AGENTS.md`, measuring the always-loaded
instruction surface rather than judging it: the file's total size in bytes and lines; its size by top-level section; the
effective bound on that surface together with the source establishing it, stating whether the loading mechanism applies
a limit of its own; the first rule that falls beyond a derived effective threshold, expressed as an estimate with its
derivation rather than as a position at which content is dropped; the growth since the newest prior report under
`docs/audits/`; and the sections and `captured:`-marked rule units responsible for that growth. The ledger SHALL
estimate the bytes safely removable from the always-loaded surface, SHALL list the rules that must remain loaded with
the risk their unavailability would carry, SHALL list the rules safe to load on demand with their trigger and retained
pointer, SHALL tabulate the extraction candidates with their destination type and retrieval-path result, SHALL carry a
separate **extraction opportunities** subsection after the ready candidates — excluded from the verdict counts, stating
that its items require the owner's selection and a dedicated design or implementation change, distinguishing an existing
destination that failed retrieval from a destination that does not yet exist, and collapsing "no opportunity" to one
line — and SHALL state the post-change verification: re-measurement, pointer-target verification, retrieval-path tests,
a search for lost unique terms, and the review gate. The ledger SHALL NOT invent a limit the loading mechanism does not
apply, and a bound it reports as configured SHALL cite the configuration that sets it.

The audit SHALL keep root `AGENTS.md` guidance scoped to what an agent must see before safely starting work: a rule a
narrower task scope governs, and whose destination is durable, project-authored, owned, and loaded or deterministically
discoverable when that scope's trigger occurs, is a candidate to move out of the always-loaded surface. The audit SHALL
NOT propose a move that would leave the reader to infer a warning, an imperative, an exception, or a target-less fact
the retained root text does not state, and SHALL NOT report a rule as a removal candidate merely for being old,
uncommon, or lengthy — the accretion class's rule for a meta rule governs that case. Where the passage's intended
structure or meaning cannot be recovered confidently, the audit SHALL report the ambiguity rather than invent a rewrite.

The audit SHALL propose an **extraction candidate** only where every one of these holds: the candidate governs a
narrower task scope than root `AGENTS.md`; its destination is durable, project-authored, and owned; that destination is
loaded or deterministically discoverable when the trigger occurs; the retained root text lets an agent identify the
trigger and the required next action without reconstructing them; the move preserves every unique imperative, warning,
exception, identifier, verification, and provenance marker; the destination already carries, or the proposed change to
it will carry, the complete transferred contract; the move reduces the always-loaded surface by a material, measured
amount; and it does not split a procedure across files such that a reader must guess an order, condition, or failure
path. The audit SHALL derive the preferred destination type from the content's own class before selecting one: a global
safety, branch, review, or repository-wide workflow rule stays at root `AGENTS.md`; guidance needed only while working
below one unambiguous directory goes to a nested `AGENTS.md`; behavior that changes a capability outcome to an existing
or proposed capability spec; a durable architecture decision, rationale, or trade-off to an existing or proposed ADR; a
procedure invoked through a named task entry point to an existing command or skill; incident history, diagnostic
evidence, or a large reference inventory used by several future tasks to an existing durable reference document; and a
subject a deterministic mechanism enforces to that mechanism's authoritative configuration or test, with a concise root
pointer. The audit SHALL NOT propose a generic "documentation" destination and SHALL NOT create a catch-all
extracted-guidance directory, and a proposed new destination SHALL have a clear owner, a stable scope, and evidence that
more than one future task can discover and use it. Internal control flow whose alternatives yield the same result SHALL
stay in `AGENTS.md` even where a spec describes the same outcome; only a mechanism whose change would change the
capability's specified behavior is a candidate. Before reporting a candidate the audit SHALL test the retrieval path —
starting from the root instruction set, stating the task trigger, following only the retained root text and normal
project discovery, and confirming the destination is reached before the governed decision must be made and carries every
transferred requirement and verification step. A failed retrieval path to an **existing** destination remains a reason
to retain the source content, and is not an extraction opportunity. For an opportunity the audit SHALL NOT claim that a
destination which does not exist passed the test: instead it SHALL verify whether the proposed retained root entry point
could name the trigger and the destination deterministically, record the missing target or discovery mechanism as the
blocking precondition, and require the dedicated change to create the target, add the retained root pointer, and run the
full test before the extraction becomes applicable.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **extraction opportunity** kept separate from its findings, a source unit
that is likely too narrow or too costly for root `AGENTS.md` but whose destination does not yet exist — and which
therefore cannot yet pass the retrieval-path test. An opportunity is not a finding: it SHALL NOT be counted in the
verdict line, SHALL NOT be reported as a removal or a route candidate, and SHALL NOT be applied by the standing
reduction unit — it is a design recommendation for the owner, who selects it and carries it out in a dedicated change.
The audit SHALL report an opportunity only where the source is materially costly in root guidance and the destination
type can be justified from the content's class, and it SHALL NOT report one merely to reduce the file's size: where the
source is global, cross-cutting, or cannot be retrieved before its decision is needed, the audit SHALL retain it at
root. Each opportunity SHALL state that its proposed destination is a design hypothesis rather than an existing source
of truth, and SHALL carry the source unit and its bounded content, the decision it governs and when it is needed, its
current loading cost and why that cost is material, its content classification, its recommended destination type, the
exact existing target or a proposed path with its owning artifact type, the missing precondition that keeps it from
being a candidate, the content that must remain at root until a destination is created and verified, the intended
root-to-destination retrieval path once a future change creates the target, and one recommended next action — retain,
create the destination in a dedicated change, or reject the extraction.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **advisory** class kept separate from its fix findings and reported without
severity, third-party inconsistency: a file the audit excludes (a generated `openspec-*` instruction file, or a vendored
`axon4to5-*` skill) that contradicts how this repository uses it. The class SHALL be bounded by a harm test — reported
only where the contradiction would mislead a workflow driven by the file, or instruct a pattern the repository's code or
conventions contradict, never a mere textual difference from the repository's own prose. Each item SHALL name the harm
and the decision it invites (report it upstream, re-vendor at a newer version, or change the repository's usage) and
SHALL NOT propose a local edit to the excluded file, which the exclusion rule forbids.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **accretion** class kept separate from both its fix findings and its advisory
class, the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product — a rule about the agent, its tooling, the per-change
workflow, or the documentation, as opposed to a fact about the product. Each item SHALL name the rule, the origin that
introduced it (established from the in-prose `captured:` marker where present, and from `git blame` / `git log -S`
otherwise), and the source used to establish it. The class SHALL be reported without severity and is not a defect: an
accreted rule may be correct and load-bearing, so the audit SHALL NOT propose removing or merging it for being meta — a
meta rule that governs no decision is a removal candidate under the conciseness analysis, not a victim of its class —
that is the user's decision on the report. The class's count SHALL use one fixed metric, so successive reports are
comparable: the number of distinct meta rule units carrying at least one `captured:` marker, each counted once however
many markers it carries — never the raw marker count, and never the number of items the report lists — and a rule
written before the marker convention carries none and falls outside the metric. The audit SHALL also state how many of
those rule units are new since the newest prior report under `docs/audits/`, reporting `none recorded` when no prior
report exists and that the figure is unavailable when it cannot be determined.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **authoring-system gap** class kept separate from its fix findings and
reported without severity, a recurring defect whose cause is a mechanism that produces or maintains the artifact rather
than the artifact's content. Each item SHALL name the mechanism, the gap in how that mechanism communicates or enforces
the applicable standard, the smallest correction at the mechanism, and how that correction would prevent or reduce the
recurrence. The class SHALL be bounded by evidence: a defect reported from a single artifact with no established link to
the mechanism that produced it is a content defect under the consistency axis, not an authoring-system gap, and the
class SHALL NOT become a route for speculative rules. The correction's handling SHALL follow the mechanism's scope: for
an in-scope mechanism (an agent definition, command, or skill under `.opencode/`) the audit proposes the correction
directly; for an editable project-owned mechanism outside the audit's scope (the `openspec/config.yaml` per-artifact
rules) it reports the gap with the correction routed to the change workflow, never applied as a local edit; and for an
excluded mechanism (a generated OpenSpec instruction file, or a vendored skill) it reports the item under the advisory
class and never proposes a local edit to it. A correction SHALL reference the authoritative standard rather than copy it
into the mechanism.

#### Scenario: An agent-tooling audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `agents-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-agents` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering consistency (contradictions, stale claims, dead
  cross-references, drift) and conciseness (duplication, trivia, length, placement) across `AGENTS.md` and the
  project-authored `.opencode/` files, each with a location and a suggested rewrite — plus, separately, any advisory
  third-party inconsistency, the accreted meta rules with their origins, and any authoring-system gap, with the merge,
  removal, and route candidate counts named in the verdict line

#### Scenario: Generated and vendored files are excluded

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent selects what to audit
- **THEN** it excludes the OpenSpec instruction files written by `openspec update` and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills,
  whose correct state is defined by their generator or upstream rather than by this repository — while a
  project-authored file with a similar name (the `opsx-tool-update` command) stays in scope

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent flags a claim, enumeration, or cross-reference
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the referenced files, workflows, or specs) before reporting it,
  so a deliberate or still-true entry is not reported as stale

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

#### Scenario: An excluded file inconsistent with our usage is reported as advisory

- **WHEN** an excluded file (a generated instruction file or a vendored skill) contradicts how this repository uses it —
  for example a vendored migration skill instructing a pattern the codebase no longer follows
- **THEN** the audit reports it in a separate advisory class, naming the harm and the decision it invites (report
  upstream, re-vendor, or change our usage), and never proposes a local edit to that file

#### Scenario: A mere textual difference is not reported

- **WHEN** an excluded file differs from the repository's own prose but would not mislead a workflow or instruct a
  contradicted pattern
- **THEN** the audit does not report it, so the advisory class stays limited to contradictions that would change what a
  reader does

#### Scenario: Accreted meta rules are reported with their origin

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports the in-scope rules that are meta rather than product as a separate accretion class, each with the
  origin that introduced it (the `captured:` marker where present, `git blame` / `git log -S` otherwise) and the source
  used, without proposing that the rule be removed or merged for being meta

#### Scenario: The accretion count uses one fixed metric

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent reports its accretion class
- **THEN** its verdict states the count as the number of distinct meta rule units carrying at least one `captured:`
  marker, each counted once regardless of how many markers it carries, together with the number of those rule units new
  since the newest prior report under `docs/audits/` (`none recorded` when no prior report exists), so the count is
  comparable across successive reports

#### Scenario: Merge and removal candidates are standing findings

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports merge candidates (with a merged text that preserves every anchor and piece of evidence the
  originals carried, and never blending two distinct lessons — or, where that text would only restate a rule the file
  already carries, a deletion of the duplicate, still counted as a `remove`, saying which) and removal candidates (rules
  that govern no decision — trivia, not a rule — with what would be lost and whether git preserves it) — as findings for
  the owner, not actions

#### Scenario: A merge candidate's pointer target is verified

- **WHEN** a merge candidate's merged text points at a spec or an ADR for content it removes
- **THEN** the audit verifies the target carries the delegated content — its behavior and the identifiers, declarations,
  and gate conditions the delegated text names — and keeps in the merged text any delegated item the target does not
  carry, saying which it kept for that reason

#### Scenario: A rule enforced by a deterministic mechanism is a route candidate

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent finds a rule whose subject an in-place deterministic mechanism already enforces
  (a build or CI gate, a lint or test, a CLI validation, or a deterministic workflow step such as the archive-time spec
  sync)
- **THEN** it reports a route candidate naming the mechanism and proposing to reduce the rule to a pointer at it, or to
  move the rule's content to the spec or ADR that owns it, with what would be lost — as a candidate for the owner, not
  an action

#### Scenario: A rule detectable only by review is not a candidate

- **WHEN** the only detector of a rule's violation is a review — a human's or a review subagent's — and no deterministic
  mechanism enforces it
- **THEN** the audit does not report the rule as a removal or route candidate, because review is not a gate and the rule
  may itself be what makes the violation visible to the reviewer

#### Scenario: A recurring defect is traced to the authoring mechanism

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent finds a defect that recurs across the artifacts one mechanism produces — a
  skill that keeps emitting dense procedural prose, or a command that omits a step the workflow needs
- **THEN** it reports an authoring-system gap naming the mechanism, the gap in how that mechanism communicates or
  enforces the standard, the smallest correction at the mechanism, and how the correction would prevent or reduce the
  recurrence — separate from its fix findings and without severity

#### Scenario: A one-off defect is not an authoring-system gap

- **WHEN** a defect appears in a single artifact and no link to the mechanism that produced it is established
- **THEN** it is reported as a content defect under the consistency axis, not as an authoring-system gap

#### Scenario: An authoring-system gap in an excluded mechanism is advisory

- **WHEN** the mechanism responsible for a recurring defect is excluded (a generated OpenSpec instruction file, or a
  vendored skill)
- **THEN** the audit reports the gap under the advisory class, naming the harm and the decision it invites, and never
  proposes a local edit to the excluded mechanism

#### Scenario: An instruction-budget ledger is reported

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent audits `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** it reports an instruction-budget ledger naming the file's total size, its size by top-level section, the
  effective bound on the always-loaded surface and its source, the first rule beyond the derived effective threshold,
  the growth since the newest prior report under `docs/audits/`, and the sections and `captured:`-marked rule units
  responsible for that growth

#### Scenario: The ledger states the bound's source and invents no limit

- **WHEN** the loading mechanism applies no size limit of its own
- **THEN** the ledger says so and reports the effective bound with the source that establishes it, rather than reporting
  a configured limit that does not exist

#### Scenario: A reduction candidate carries its decision and its cost

- **WHEN** the auditor reports a merge, removal, route, or extraction candidate
- **THEN** the candidate names its location, the decision its rule changes, the task or condition that requires it, the
  unique content the change would otherwise lose, its current loading cost, its disposition, and the evidence that the
  surviving guidance preserves the same obligation

#### Scenario: An extraction candidate meets every condition

- **WHEN** the auditor proposes an extraction candidate
- **THEN** every condition the extraction analysis states holds, and the candidate names its destination type, the
  retained root text, and the authoritative destination

#### Scenario: A failed retrieval path is a reason to retain the content

- **WHEN** the retrieval-path test cannot reach the destination before the governed decision must be made, or the
  destination omits a transferred requirement or verification step
- **THEN** the audit reports the failure and retains the content rather than proposing the extraction

#### Scenario: Internal control flow is not extracted

- **WHEN** a spec describes the same outcome but changing the rule's mechanism would not change the capability's
  specified behavior
- **THEN** the audit keeps that control flow in `AGENTS.md` and does not propose extracting it

#### Scenario: A rule is not a removal candidate for being lengthy

- **WHEN** a rule is old, uncommon, or lengthy but governs a decision
- **THEN** it is not reported as a removal candidate, and the reason it stays is stated

#### Scenario: Guidance is not moved where the reader would infer it

- **WHEN** the retained root text would leave a warning, an imperative, an exception, or a target-less fact to be
  inferred
- **THEN** the audit keeps the rule at root rather than proposing the move

#### Scenario: An extraction opportunity is reported where no destination exists

- **WHEN** a source unit is materially costly in root guidance but no existing project-authored destination owns its
  subject
- **THEN** the audit reports an extraction opportunity naming its content classification, its recommended destination
  type, the proposed destination with its owning artifact type, and the missing precondition, and states that the
  proposed destination is a design hypothesis rather than an existing source of truth

#### Scenario: An extraction opportunity is not a finding and is never applied

- **WHEN** the audit reports an extraction opportunity
- **THEN** it is excluded from the verdict line, is not reported as a removal or a route candidate, and the standing
  reduction unit never applies it

#### Scenario: A global rule is retained rather than extracted

- **WHEN** the source is global, cross-cutting, or cannot be retrieved before its decision is needed
- **THEN** the audit retains it at root and reports no extraction opportunity for it

#### Scenario: A failed path to an existing destination is not an opportunity

- **WHEN** a destination exists but the retrieval path to it fails
- **THEN** the audit reports the failure as a reason to retain the source content, not as an extraction opportunity

#### Scenario: A proposed new destination needs an owner and a scope

- **WHEN** the audit proposes a destination that does not exist yet
- **THEN** it names the owning artifact type, a stable scope, and evidence that more than one future task can discover
  and use it, and it proposes no generic documentation destination and no catch-all extracted-guidance directory

#### Scenario: The ledger carries the opportunities subsection

- **WHEN** the audit reports its instruction-budget ledger
- **THEN** a separate extraction-opportunities subsection follows the ready candidates, is excluded from the verdict
  counts, states that its items need the owner's selection and a dedicated design or implementation change,
  distinguishes an existing destination that failed retrieval from a destination that does not yet exist, and collapses
  "no opportunity" to one line

### Requirement: Audit reduction candidates are applied by a standing owner-gated unit

The repository SHALL provide a standing, owner-gated unit, invoked by an `/apply-audit-reductions` command, that applies
an audit report's reduction candidates (its merge, removal, route, and extraction findings), routing a content-move to
the change workflow, so they do not age. It SHALL never apply an **extraction opportunity**, which is not a candidate:
an opportunity is a design recommendation the owner carries out in a dedicated change. It SHALL present the candidates
for the owner's selection, apply only the approved ones, and pass the per-unit review gate before the change ships; it
SHALL NOT run automatically.

#### Scenario: A report's reduction candidates are presented and applied

- **WHEN** the owner invokes the unit for the newest report under `docs/audits/` (a date carrying more than one report
  is offered for the owner to choose), or for one they name
- **THEN** it presents that report's reduction candidates and applies only the ones the owner approves

#### Scenario: An applied merge applies the candidate's merged text

- **WHEN** the unit applies an approved merge candidate
- **THEN** it applies the candidate's merged text, or deletes the duplicate the candidate flags

#### Scenario: An applied route reduces the rule to a verified pointer

- **WHEN** the unit applies an approved route candidate that reduces the rule to a pointer
- **THEN** it reduces the rule to a pointer at the target the candidate names, following the capture bullet's
  pointer/trim rule

#### Scenario: A route candidate that moves content into a spec or ADR is routed to a change

- **WHEN** an approved route candidate proposes moving the rule's content into the spec or ADR that owns it
- **THEN** the unit routes that edit through the normal change workflow rather than editing the spec or ADR inline

#### Scenario: An applied removal deletes a rule that governs no decision

- **WHEN** the unit applies an approved removal candidate
- **THEN** it deletes the rule the candidate names, recording what the deletion loses and whether git preserves it

#### Scenario: An applied reduction clears its parked entry

- **WHEN** the report's candidate was parked in `docs/ideas.md`
- **THEN** the unit removes the applied entry

#### Scenario: Application is owner-gated and reviewed

- **WHEN** the unit applies reductions
- **THEN** it does so only on the owner's selection, runs the `review-quick` subagent over the result until clean, and
  asks for the owner's manual review before the change ships

#### Scenario: An extraction candidate's application is routed to a change

- **WHEN** the owner approves an extraction candidate
- **THEN** the unit routes the move to the normal change workflow rather than editing the destination inline, since the
  move creates or changes a destination that the change owns

#### Scenario: An extraction opportunity is never applied

- **WHEN** the report carries an extraction opportunity
- **THEN** the unit does not present or apply it, because an opportunity is a design recommendation rather than a
  candidate
