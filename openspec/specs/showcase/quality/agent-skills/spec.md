# showcase/quality/agent-skills Specification

## Purpose

Provides the repository's agent capabilities: curated, vendored skill sets under `.opencode/skills/` (so agents can run
the AxonIQ Axon 4→5 migration recipes against this codebase) and the locally-defined quality-gate and analysis subagents
under `.opencode/agent/` — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents, the experience-analyzer, the visual and
diagram agents, and the on-demand auditors of the project-owned agent tooling (the guidance and project-authored
`.opencode/` files, plus any generated or vendored file that contradicts how the repository uses it), of the
`openspec/specs/` corpus, and of the architecture (the ADRs, the service, module, and spec-decomposition surface, and
where a deliberate decision's rationale is not recorded).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Vendored agent skills are available to agents

The repository SHALL vendor the AxonIQ `axoniq-migration` plugin skills (version 0.2.2) from the `AxonIQ/agent-skills`
repository under `.opencode/skills/`, so that opencode discovers them as project skills. The vendored set SHALL include
`axon4to5-migrate-code`, `axon4to5-openrewrite`, and `axon4to5-isolatedtest`. Vendoring SHALL NOT add the skill files to
any Gradle module's classpath or to any built Docker image.

#### Scenario: Migration skills are discoverable by agents

- **WHEN** an agent lists the project's skills in `.opencode/skills/`
- **THEN** it finds `axon4to5-migrate-code`, `axon4to5-openrewrite`, and `axon4to5-isolatedtest`, each with a `SKILL.md`
  entry point and its referenced assets

#### Scenario: Vendored skills do not affect the application build

- **WHEN** the project build runs any Gradle task (compile, test, package)
- **THEN** the vendored skill files under `.opencode/skills/` are not part of any module's source set, classpath, or
  Docker image

### Requirement: Vendored skills carry version provenance

The vendored skills SHALL record their upstream source repository and the exact plugin version they were copied from, so
that an upstream update is a deliberate, reviewable change rather than silent drift.

#### Scenario: Provenance is recorded

- **WHEN** a maintainer inspects the vendored skills or the `agent-skills` capability spec
- **THEN** the upstream source (`AxonIQ/agent-skills`), plugin (`axoniq-migration`), and version (0.2.2) are documented

#### Scenario: Updating to a new plugin version is an explicit change

- **WHEN** a new `axoniq-migration` plugin version is published upstream
- **THEN** refreshing the vendored skills is performed as a reviewed change that updates the recorded version, rather
  than applied silently

### Requirement: Experience analysis is available to agents

The repository SHALL provide an `experience-analyzer` agent subagent that, given a gathered digest of recent experience
(merged pull requests, archived changes, `AGENTS.md` gotchas, and `docs/ideas.md`), produces a retrospective and
forward-looking improvement suggestions. The retrospective SHALL group shipped PRs by theme, summarize lessons learned,
and record went-well/went-wrong observations. Each improvement suggestion SHALL be classified as a system suggestion
(addressed via `docs/ideas.md` or an OpenSpec proposal) or a process suggestion (addressed via `AGENTS.md` or a subagent
definition). The agent SHALL propose the retrospective and suggestions without editing files; the main agent verifies
and applies them.

#### Scenario: A retrospective is produced from gathered experience

- **WHEN** the main agent gathers a digest of recent experience and invokes the `experience-analyzer` subagent
- **THEN** it returns a retrospective grouping shipped PRs by theme, summarizing lessons, and recording went-well and
  went-wrong observations

#### Scenario: Improvement suggestions are classified

- **WHEN** the `experience-analyzer` subagent proposes improvements
- **THEN** each suggestion is labeled as a system change (→ `docs/ideas.md` or a proposal) or a process change (→
  `AGENTS.md` or a subagent definition), so the main agent can route it

#### Scenario: The agent does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `experience-analyzer` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed text and suggestions without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies them

### Requirement: Per-change quality-gate and analysis subagents are available

The repository SHALL provide locally-defined agent subagents under `.opencode/agent/` for the per-change quality gates
and analysis workflows — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents, and the visual and diagram agents — each
described by the scenarios below or by its own requirement in this capability. Each SHALL be invocable by the main
agent, with its purpose described in its agent definition and (where relevant) in `AGENTS.md`.

#### Scenario: Quick review runs after proposal and implementation

- **WHEN** a change's proposal (planning artifacts) or its implementation is finished
- **THEN** the `review-quick` subagent reviews it against the change's planning artifacts, and the loop repeats until it
  reports no new observations before a manual review is requested

#### Scenario: Thorough review is available on demand

- **WHEN** a deep review pass is wanted (drift, correctness, architecture, conventions)
- **THEN** the `review-thorough` subagent reviews the change against its delta specs, tasks, and the surrounding code

#### Scenario: Lessons are captured after implementation

- **WHEN** a change's implementation quick review is clean
- **THEN** the `lesson-capture` subagent proposes `AGENTS.md` gotchas/conventions from the change's lessons, which the
  main agent verifies and applies
- **AND** each proposed addition names the existing bullet it extends, or states that no bullet covers it — a new rule
  merges into or replaces one rather than accreting

#### Scenario: Screenshots are reviewed visually

- **WHEN** the main agent needs to inspect a screenshot, image, or visual UI state (e.g. web-UI styling)
- **THEN** the `vision` subagent reads the image and returns a description, so the text-only main agent can delegate
  visual review

#### Scenario: ASCII diagrams are drawn by the pro-model diagrammer

- **WHEN** a diagram needs to be created, aligned, or fixed (e.g. a README flow diagram)
- **THEN** the `diagrammer` subagent renders it with the pro model: it establishes the semantic mapping (which span
  starts and ends where), aligns by character width, and preserves deliberate asymmetry — so the cheap flash main agent
  does not spend effort on ASCII geometry

### Requirement: The spec corpus is audited for structure and consistency

The repository SHALL provide a `specs-auditor` agent subagent that audits the `openspec/specs/` corpus for **structure
and consistency**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL cover, at least: each spec's `#`
title matching its capability path; each Purpose describing the requirements the spec holds; requirement-header and
requirement-body conventions (a declarative header, a SHALL body, WHEN/THEN scenarios); requirements duplicated or
near-duplicated across specs; and dead cross-references to renamed classes, files, or configuration the specs cite. The
audit SHALL NOT verify behavior against the implementation — that remains with the change workflow's review loop and the
archive-time spec sync. Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository, and SHALL be reported grouped by severity
with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. A requirement header reused across two genuinely different
capabilities SHALL be reported for judgment rather than treated as a defect. The subagent SHALL propose its findings
without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

#### Scenario: A spec-corpus audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `specs-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-specs` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering title/path match, Purpose fit, requirement conventions,
  cross-spec duplication, and dead cross-references, each with a location and a suggested rewrite

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent flags a title, cross-reference, or apparent duplicate
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the capability path, the referenced file or symbol, the bodies of
  the requirements involved) before reporting it, so a still-true title or a legitimately shared header is not reported
  as a defect

#### Scenario: Behavior drift is out of scope

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent audits the corpus
- **THEN** it does not verify requirement scenarios against the implementation, leaving behavior-vs-code drift to the
  change workflow's review loop and the archive-time spec sync

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

### Requirement: Project-owned agent tooling is audited for consistency and conciseness

The repository SHALL provide an `agents-auditor` agent subagent that audits the project-owned agent tooling —
`AGENTS.md` and the project-authored files under `.opencode/agent/`, `.opencode/commands/`, and `.opencode/skills/` —
for **consistency** and **conciseness**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL exclude files
the repository does not author: the generator-owned OpenSpec instruction files (the commands and skills written by
`openspec update`) and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills (copied verbatim from the upstream AxonIQ repository); a
project-authored file that shares a generated file's name prefix (e.g. the `opsx-tool-update` command) SHALL remain in
scope. The audit SHALL cover, at least: contradictions between entries or files, stale claims and enumerations the
repository has outgrown, dead cross-references, and drift from the code/workflows/specs the prose describes
(consistency); and duplicated or near-duplicate entries, one-off trivia, over-long or over-specific entries, and
misplaced entries (conciseness). Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the
prose alone, and SHALL be reported with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. The subagent SHALL propose its
findings without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

The audit SHALL additionally report, as an **advisory** class kept separate from its fix findings and reported without
severity, third-party inconsistency: a file the audit excludes (a generated `openspec-*` instruction file, or a vendored
`axon4to5-*` skill) that contradicts how this repository uses it. The class SHALL be bounded by a harm test — reported
only where the contradiction would mislead a workflow driven by the file, or instruct a pattern the repository's code or
conventions contradict, never a mere textual difference from the repository's own prose. Each item SHALL name the harm
and the decision it invites (report it upstream, re-vendor at a newer version, or change the repository's usage) and
SHALL NOT propose a local edit to the excluded file, which the exclusion rule forbids.

#### Scenario: An agent-tooling audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `agents-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-agents` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering consistency (contradictions, stale claims, dead
  cross-references, drift) and conciseness (duplication, trivia, length, placement) across `AGENTS.md` and the
  project-authored `.opencode/` files, each with a location and a suggested rewrite — plus, separately, any advisory
  third-party inconsistency

#### Scenario: Generated and vendored files are excluded

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent selects what to audit
- **THEN** it excludes the OpenSpec instruction files written by `openspec update` and the vendored `axon4to5-*` skills,
  whose correct state is defined by their generator or upstream rather than by this repository — while a
  project-authored file with a similar name (the `opsx-tool-update` command) stays in scope

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent flags a claim, enumeration, or cross-reference
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the referenced files, workflows, or specs) before reporting it,
  so a deliberate or still-true entry is not reported as stale

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

#### Scenario: An excluded file inconsistent with our usage is reported as advisory

- **WHEN** an excluded file (a generated instruction file or a vendored skill) contradicts how this repository uses it —
  for example a vendored migration skill instructing a pattern the codebase no longer follows
- **THEN** the audit reports it in a separate advisory class, naming the harm and the decision it invites (report
  upstream, re-vendor, or change our usage), and never proposes a local edit to that file

#### Scenario: A mere textual difference is not reported

- **WHEN** an excluded file differs from the repository's own prose but would not mislead a workflow or instruct a
  contradicted pattern
- **THEN** the audit does not report it, so the advisory class stays limited to contradictions that would change what a
  reader does

### Requirement: The architecture is audited for drift from its recorded decisions

The repository SHALL provide an `architecture-auditor` agent subagent that audits the project's architecture — the ADRs
under `docs/adr/` together with the architectural surface (the service boundaries, the module dependency graph, and the
spec corpus's capability decomposition) — for **drift**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL
report in two clearly separated sections: verified findings and advisory observations. Verified findings SHALL cover, at
least: an ADR's Decision contradicted by the implementation; an ADR `Status` that is stale, or whose supersession is not
recorded as `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`; a cross-reference to an `ADR-NNNN` that does not exist; a cross-cutting structural
decision made in the code or configuration with no ADR; a dependency or service-boundary direction the architecture does
not sanction; and a spec role-group decomposition that no longer matches the module or service structure. Each finding
SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the documents alone, and SHALL be reported with its
location and a concrete suggested correction. Advisory observations SHALL carry design judgment for which the
architecture provides no reference to check against — cohesion and coupling, decomposition, and apparent gaps in the ADR
set — and SHALL be reported separately from findings, without severity, and SHALL NOT be treated as defects to fix. The
audit SHALL NOT verify behavior against the implementation (the change workflow's review loop and the archive-time spec
sync own that), SHALL NOT audit the spec corpus's internal structure (the `specs-auditor` owns that), and SHALL NOT
re-check a property an existing gate already enforces. The subagent SHALL propose its findings without modifying files;
the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

#### Scenario: An architecture audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `architecture-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-architecture` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings and advisory observations in two separated sections, the findings covering ADR drift, ADR
  `Status` integrity, unrecorded decisions, dependency/service-boundary direction, and spec-decomposition fit, each with
  a location and a suggested correction

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent flags an ADR, a cross-reference, or a boundary
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the ADR file, the module and service configuration, the
  referenced code or spec) before reporting it, so a still-true decision or a deliberate structure is not reported as
  drift

#### Scenario: Advisory observations are reported separately from findings

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent forms a design judgment (cohesion, decomposition, ADR-set gaps)
- **THEN** it reports it in the advisory section, without severity and not as a defect, so the main agent does not treat
  it as actionable without the user's decision

#### Scenario: Behavior and intra-corpus checks are out of scope

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent audits the architecture
- **THEN** it does not verify behavior against the implementation, does not audit the spec corpus's internal structure,
  and does not re-check a property an existing gate already enforces

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and corrections without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies
  those the user approves

### Requirement: Unexplained design intent is surfaced for clarification

The `architecture-auditor` subagent SHALL report, in its advisory section, the deliberate choices and deliberate
absences whose rationale is not recorded in the repository. It SHALL sweep the surfaces where a deliberate decision
implies a rejected alternative: dependency `exclude(...)` declarations; major-version-suppressed coordinates in
`config/dependency-updates/major-disabled.properties`; suppression annotations that encode a design choice
(`@SuppressWarnings`) and deprecated-API usages the project still carries; and deferrals or band-aids recorded in an ADR
or parked in `docs/ideas.md`. It SHALL verify by searching the repository that no rationale is recorded before reporting
an item, and SHALL NOT report a choice whose rationale is already recorded. Each item SHALL name the deliberate choice
or absence with its location, and SHALL state the question whose answer would record the missing rationale. The items
SHALL be advisory: reported without severity, and SHALL NOT be treated as defects to fix, because only the project owner
can say which unrecorded rationales matter.

#### Scenario: An unexplained deliberate choice is surfaced as a question

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent sweeps a deliberate choice (a dependency exclusion, a suppressed
  major-version coordinate, a suppression annotation, a retained deprecated API, or a recorded deferral) and finds no
  rationale recorded for it
- **THEN** it reports the choice and its location in the advisory section together with the question whose answer would
  record the rationale, so the owner can triage it

#### Scenario: A recorded rationale is not reported

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent sweeps a deliberate choice whose rationale is already recorded (a
  suppressed major-version coordinate with a requirement in a spec, a deferral with an ADR, or a suppression convention
  in `AGENTS.md`)
- **THEN** it does not report that choice, so the audit's output stays a list of open questions

#### Scenario: Intent-clarification items are advisory

- **WHEN** the `architecture-auditor` subagent reports where clarification of intent is missing
- **THEN** it reports those items in the advisory section, without severity and not as defects, so the main agent does
  not "fix" them without the user's decision

### Requirement: Report-producing subagents follow a shared report contract

Every subagent that reports findings to the main agent — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents and the
on-demand auditors of the agent tooling, the spec corpus, and the architecture — SHALL follow one shared output
contract, so a report is skimmable and its verdict is read first. The contract SHALL bound the report, not the analysis:
a subagent SHALL verify its claims as thoroughly as before and report them in the contract's shape.

#### Scenario: A report opens with its verdict

- **WHEN** a report-producing subagent returns its findings
- **THEN** the first line states the outcome — whether anything remains and how many items; an audit with an advisory
  section names both its findings and advisory counts
- **AND** a report with nothing to report says so in that first line rather than in a closing sentence

#### Scenario: Each item is budgeted

- **WHEN** the subagent reports a proposed addition, a finding, or an observation
- **THEN** the item names itself, its anchor (`file:line` where applicable), and one line of evidence
- **AND** the budget is per item, not a cap on the report's total, so a report with many genuine findings is longer than
  one with few

#### Scenario: Verified-and-set-aside candidates are summarized

- **WHEN** the subagent has verified a candidate and concluded it is already covered, rejected, or not a defect
- **THEN** it reports that in one line, or collapses several into one summary line, rather than a paragraph each

#### Scenario: No alternatives are offered

- **WHEN** the subagent proposes a change or a correction
- **THEN** it states the recommendation, not a menu of alternatives — the calling agent makes the choice
