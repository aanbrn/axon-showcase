# showcase/quality/agent-skills Specification

## Purpose

Provides the repository's agent capabilities: curated, vendored skill sets under `.opencode/skills/` (so agents can run
the AxonIQ Axon 4→5 migration recipes against this codebase) and the locally-defined quality-gate and analysis subagents
under `.opencode/agent/` — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents, the experience-analyzer, and the on-demand
auditors of `AGENTS.md` and the `openspec/specs/` corpus.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Vendored agent skills are available to agents

The repository SHALL vendor the AxonIQ `axoniq-migration` plugin skills (version 0.2.2) from the `AxonIQ/agent-skills`
repository under `.opencode/skills/`, so that opencode discovers them as project skills. The vendored set SHALL include
`axon4to5-migrate-code`, `axon4to5-openrewrite`, and `axon4to5-isolatedtest`. Vendoring SHALL NOT add the skill files to
any Gradle module's classpath or to any built Docker image.

#### Scenario: Migration skills are discoverable by agents

- **WHEN** an agent lists the project's skills in `.opencode/skills/`
- **THEN** it finds `axon4to5-migrate-code`, `axon4to5-openrewrite`, and `axon4to5-isolatedtest`, each with a `SKILL.md`
  entry point and its referenced assets

#### Scenario: Vendored skills do not affect the application build

- **WHEN** the project build runs any Gradle task (compile, test, package)
- **THEN** the vendored skill files under `.opencode/skills/` are not part of any module's source set, classpath, or
  Docker image

### Requirement: Vendored skills carry version provenance

The vendored skills SHALL record their upstream source repository and the exact plugin version they were copied from, so
that an upstream update is a deliberate, reviewable change rather than silent drift.

#### Scenario: Provenance is recorded

- **WHEN** a maintainer inspects the vendored skills or the `agent-skills` capability spec
- **THEN** the upstream source (`AxonIQ/agent-skills`), plugin (`axoniq-migration`), and version (0.2.2) are documented

#### Scenario: Updating to a new plugin version is an explicit change

- **WHEN** a new `axoniq-migration` plugin version is published upstream
- **THEN** refreshing the vendored skills is performed as a reviewed change that updates the recorded version, rather
  than applied silently

### Requirement: Experience analysis is available to agents

The repository SHALL provide an `experience-analyzer` agent subagent that, given a gathered digest of recent experience
(merged pull requests, archived changes, `AGENTS.md` gotchas, and `docs/ideas.md`), produces a retrospective and
forward-looking improvement suggestions. The retrospective SHALL group shipped PRs by theme, summarize lessons learned,
and record went-well/went-wrong observations. Each improvement suggestion SHALL be classified as a system suggestion
(addressed via `docs/ideas.md` or an OpenSpec proposal) or a process suggestion (addressed via `AGENTS.md`). The agent
SHALL propose the retrospective and suggestions without editing files; the main agent verifies and applies them.

#### Scenario: A retrospective is produced from gathered experience

- **WHEN** the main agent gathers a digest of recent experience and invokes the `experience-analyzer` subagent
- **THEN** it returns a retrospective grouping shipped PRs by theme, summarizing lessons, and recording went-well and
  went-wrong observations

#### Scenario: Improvement suggestions are classified

- **WHEN** the `experience-analyzer` subagent proposes improvements
- **THEN** each suggestion is labeled as a system change (→ `docs/ideas.md` or a proposal) or a process change (→
  `AGENTS.md`), so the main agent can route it

#### Scenario: The agent does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `experience-analyzer` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed text and suggestions without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies them

### Requirement: Per-change quality-gate and analysis subagents are available

The repository SHALL provide locally-defined agent subagents under `.opencode/agent/` for the per-change quality gates
and analysis workflows — the per-change review and lesson-capture agents, and the visual and diagram agents — each
described by the scenarios below or by its own requirement in this capability. Each SHALL be invocable by the main
agent, with its purpose described in its agent definition and (where relevant) in `AGENTS.md`.

#### Scenario: Quick review runs after proposal and implementation

- **WHEN** a change's proposal (planning artifacts) or its implementation is finished
- **THEN** the `review-quick` subagent reviews it against the change's planning artifacts, and the loop repeats until it
  reports no new observations before a manual review is requested

#### Scenario: Thorough review is available on demand

- **WHEN** a deep review pass is wanted (drift, correctness, architecture, conventions)
- **THEN** the `review-thorough` subagent reviews the change against its delta specs, tasks, and the surrounding code

#### Scenario: Lessons are captured after implementation

- **WHEN** a change's implementation quick review is clean
- **THEN** the `lesson-capture` subagent proposes `AGENTS.md` gotchas/conventions from the change's lessons, which the
  main agent verifies and applies

#### Scenario: Screenshots are reviewed visually

- **WHEN** the main agent needs to inspect a screenshot, image, or visual UI state (e.g. web-UI styling)
- **THEN** the `vision` subagent reads the image and returns a description, so the text-only main agent can delegate
  visual review

#### Scenario: ASCII diagrams are drawn by the pro-model diagrammer

- **WHEN** a diagram needs to be created, aligned, or fixed (e.g. a README flow diagram)
- **THEN** the `diagrammer` subagent renders it with the pro model: it establishes the semantic mapping (which span
  starts and ends where), aligns by character width, and preserves deliberate asymmetry — so the cheap flash main agent
  does not spend effort on ASCII geometry

### Requirement: AGENTS.md is audited for consistency and conciseness

The repository SHALL provide an `agents-auditor` agent subagent that audits `AGENTS.md` — the agent's persistent
guidance — for **consistency** and **conciseness**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL
cover, at least: contradictions between entries, stale claims and enumerations the repository has outgrown, dead
cross-references, and drift from the code/workflows/specs the prose describes (consistency); and duplicated or
near-duplicate entries, one-off trivia, over-long or over-specific entries, and misplaced entries (conciseness). Each
finding SHALL be verified against the repository rather than inferred from the prose alone, and SHALL be reported with
its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. The subagent SHALL propose its findings without modifying files; the main
agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

#### Scenario: An AGENTS.md audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `agents-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-agents` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering consistency (contradictions, stale claims, dead
  cross-references, drift) and conciseness (duplication, trivia, length, placement), each with a location and a
  suggested rewrite

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent flags a claim, enumeration, or cross-reference
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the referenced files, workflows, or specs) before reporting it,
  so a deliberate or still-true entry is not reported as stale

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `agents-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves

### Requirement: The spec corpus is audited for structure and consistency

The repository SHALL provide a `specs-auditor` agent subagent that audits the `openspec/specs/` corpus for **structure
and consistency**, and reports its findings without editing files. The audit SHALL cover, at least: each spec's `#`
title matching its capability path; each Purpose describing the requirements the spec holds; requirement-header and
requirement-body conventions (a declarative header, a SHALL body, WHEN/THEN scenarios); requirements duplicated or
near-duplicated across specs; and dead cross-references to renamed classes, files, or configuration the specs cite. The
audit SHALL NOT verify behavior against the implementation — that remains with the change workflow's review loop and the
archive-time spec sync. Each finding SHALL be verified against the repository, and SHALL be reported grouped by severity
with its location and a concrete suggested rewrite. A requirement header reused across two genuinely different
capabilities SHALL be reported for judgment rather than treated as a defect. The subagent SHALL propose its findings
without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those the user approves.

#### Scenario: A spec-corpus audit is produced

- **WHEN** the main agent invokes the `specs-auditor` subagent (e.g. via the `/audit-specs` command)
- **THEN** it returns findings grouped by severity, covering title/path match, Purpose fit, requirement conventions,
  cross-spec duplication, and dead cross-references, each with a location and a suggested rewrite

#### Scenario: Findings are verified against the repository

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent flags a title, cross-reference, or apparent duplicate
- **THEN** it checks the claim against the repository (the capability path, the referenced file or symbol, the bodies of
  the requirements involved) before reporting it, so a still-true title or a legitimately shared header is not reported
  as a defect

#### Scenario: Behavior drift is out of scope

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent audits the corpus
- **THEN** it does not verify requirement scenarios against the implementation, leaving behavior-vs-code drift to the
  change workflow's review loop and the archive-time spec sync

#### Scenario: The auditor does not edit files itself

- **WHEN** the `specs-auditor` subagent runs
- **THEN** it returns proposed findings and rewrites without modifying files; the main agent verifies and applies those
  the user approves
